# Matrix Calculations

Trying to use [PreTeXt](https://pretextbook.org/) and [Runestone](https://landing.runestone.academy/) to 
create an open-source resource for two 1-credit courses required for 
math and computer science majors at Franciscan University of Steubenville.  
Little to no theory, lots of calculations; a good basis (pun intended) for taking our 
Intermediate Linear Algebra course that's more abstract and proof-heavy.  

Very much a work in progress, but currently deployed at [https://tanaquil18.github.io/matrixtheory/frontmatter.html](https://tanaquil18.github.io/matrixtheory/frontmatter.html)
