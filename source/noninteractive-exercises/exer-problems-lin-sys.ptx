                A carpenter can make two sizes of table, grande and venti.
                The grande table requires <m>4</m> table legs and <m>1</m> table top;

                Show how the equality <m>y = ae^{bx}</m> leads us to the equation <m>\ln(y) = \ln(a) + bx</m>, which is linear in <m>x</m>.

                these are not linear equations.

                Plugging in the points for <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> in the equation <m>\ln y = \ln(a) + bx</m>,
                we have equations

                To solve,
                <me>
                \left[\begin{array}{ccc}  1 \amp 1\amp \ln 2 \\ 1 \amp  2 \amp \ln 4 \\ \end{array} \right] \rrefarrow \left[\begin{array}{ccc}  1\amp 0\amp 0\\0\amp 1\amp \ln 2\\ \end{array} \right]

            <li>
            <p>
                Since <m>\ln a = 0</m>, we know that <m>a = e^0 = 1</m>.

            extra points or two point conversions
