  <title>Problem Solving with Linear Systems</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
        Most of the problems we've seen so far have started with a given linear system, and we learned how
        to find the solution(s) to the system by performing Gauss-Jordan elimination and interpreting the 
        resulting reduced row echelon form. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In this section, we will consider problems where the linear system is <q>hidden</q>, that is, not stated in the problem.
        We will create a linear system to solve the problem, and we will also need to interpret the possible solution(s)
         in terms of the context of the question, where it's possible that not all values of the variables make sense.
    </p>
  </introduction>

  <subsection xml:id="subsec-problems-lin-sys-bc">
    <title>Prepare</title>
    <p>
        Let's start with an example.   
    </p>
    <example xml:id="ex_application_1"><title>Seats in a Baseball Stadium</title>
        <p>
            A baseball stadium has seating arranged in three sections. As part of a special promotion, guests will receive two of three prizes.
            Guests seated in Sections A and B will receive a hat, guests seated in Sections B and C will receive a shirt, 
            and guests seated in Sections A and C will receive a hot dog. The promoters told the stadium managers of their plans, 
            and asked how many seats were in each section. 
            The managers, thinking they were being helpful, told the promoters they would need <m>105</m> hats, <m>103</m> shirts,
            and <m>88</m> hot dogs, and they have since been unavailable for further help. How many seats are in each section?
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to answer this question, we need to make we know what is being asked.
            The final sentence of the question asks: <q>How many seats are in each section?</q>
        </p>
        <p>
            Since we are trying to solve for the number of seats in each section, those should be our variables.
            Let <m>x_1</m> be the number of seats in Section A, <m>x_2</m> be the number of seats in Section B,
             and <m>x_3</m> be the number of seats in Section C.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now we use the information given to create linear equations. We were told that hats go to guests 
            in Sections A and B and that we'll need <m>105</m> hats, which means that
            <me>
            x_1+x_2 = 105.
            </me>
            Proceeding in a similar fashion,
            we get two more equations,
            <md>
              <mrow> x_2+x_3 \amp = 103 </mrow>
              <mrow> x_1+x_3 \amp = 88 </mrow>
            </md>.
            Thus our linear system is
            <md>
            <mrow> \amp x_1\amp \amp +  \amp \amp x_2\amp \amp \amp \amp \amp \amp = 105 </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp \amp \amp \amp \amp x_2\amp  \amp +\amp   \amp x_3\amp \amp = 103 </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp x_1  \amp \amp +\amp  \amp \amp  \amp \amp  \amp x_3\amp \amp =88 </mrow>
            </md>
            and the corresponding augmented matrix is
            <me>
            \left[\begin{array}{cccc} 1\amp 1\amp 0\amp 105\\0\amp 1\amp 1\amp 103\\1\amp 0\amp 1\amp 88\\ \end{array} \right]
            </me>
        </p>
        <p>
            To solve our system,
            we put this matrix into reduced row echelon form and get
            <me>
            \left[\begin{array}{cccc} 1\amp 1\amp 0\amp 105\\0\amp 1\amp 1\amp 103\\1\amp 0\amp 1\amp 88\\ \end{array} \right] \rrefarrow \left[\begin{array}{cccc} 1\amp 0\amp 0\amp 45\\0\amp 1\amp 0\amp 60\\0\amp 0\amp 1\amp 43\\ \end{array} \right]
            </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since <m>x_1=45</m>, this means that Section A has <m>45</m> seats.
            Similarly, we see that Section B has <m>60</m> seats, and Section C has <m>43</m> seats. 
            This is a reasonable solution because the number of seats in each section is 
            nonnegative and a whole number. 
        </p>
    </example>
    <p>
      Let's recap and generalize our steps.
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            We made sure we knew what the problem was asking. (<q>How many seats in each section?</q>)
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            We gave names to the unknown number of seats in each section. 
            (Section A had <m>x_1</m> number of seats, Section B had <m>x_2</m>, and there were 
            <m>x_3</m> seats in Section C.)
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            We used the information given in the problem to write down linear equations involving those variable names.  
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            We constructed an augmented matrix from the system of linear equations, and put the matrix into reduced row echelon form.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            We made sure the solution(s) obtained from the reduced row echelon form made sense in the context of the problem.  
            (For example, the number of seats in Section A couldn't have been a number like <m>-4.78</m>.)
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>This set of problem-solving steps is important enough to say again.</p>

    <p>
      Let's do another example, one which involves balancing a chemical equation.
      <fn>All chemical reaction problems found in this text are thanks to Gregory Bard and Gergely Sirokman.</fn> 
    </p>
    <example>
      <p>
        When chemicals react, no elements are created or destroyed; they merely recombine into different substances.  
        For example, a blow torch works by burning acetylene <m>C_2H_2</m> in the presence of oxygen <m>O_2</m>.  The result is carbon
        dioxide <m>CO_2</m> and water <m>H_2 O</m>. If there were <m>4</m> atoms of carbon (as part of the acetylene)
        before the reaction, then there have to be <m>4</m> atoms of carbon (in the form of carbon dioxide) after the reaction also.  
      </p>
      <p>
        In chemistry, balancing a chemical equation means finding the smallest numbers of the different molecules involved in the reaction. 
        Most students of chemistry balance equations by guessing and checking, but there's actually a system of linear equations involved, which means there's an
        algorithm which always leads to a solution.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's balance the blow torch reaction, using our problem solving steps.
        <me>
          <fillin characters="1"/>C_2H_2 + <fillin characters="1" />O_2 \longrightarrow <fillin characters="1" /> CO_2 + <fillin characters="1" />H_2O
        </me>
        
      </p>
      <p>
        We need to find the coefficients of each of the molecules, so those are our unknowns.  Let's say there are
        <m>x_1</m> many molecules of <m>C_2H_2</m>, and <m>x_2</m> many molecules of <m>O_2</m>, and let
         <m>x_3</m> be the number of molecules of <m>CO_2</m> and <m>x_4</m> be the number of molecules of <m>H_2O</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now we look at each element and see how many atoms there are before and after the reaction, that is, 
        before the arrow and after the arrow.  For carbon,
        there are <m>x_1</m> molecules of <m>C_2H_2</m>, which means there are <m>2</m> carbon atoms in each of the <m>x_1</m>
        molecules of acetylene, which means there are <m>2x_1</m> atoms before the reaction takes place.  After the reaction (or after the arrow),
         there are <m>x_3</m> atoms of carbon dioxide and one carbon atom in each molecule of carbon dioxide, which leads to the
        equation <m>2x_1=x_3</m>, or restated as 
        <me>
          2x_1-x_3=0
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next, we examine hydrogen.  Before the reaction there were <m>2x_1</m> hydrogen atoms, and after the reaction
        there are <m>2x_4</m> hydrogen atoms.  This gives the equation <m>2x_1=2x_4</m>, or
        <me>
          2x_1-2x_4=0
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, we look at oxygen.  There were <m>2x_2</m> oxygen atoms before the reaction took place and
        <m>2x_3+x_4</m> oxygen atoms after the reaction, which gives us the equation <m>2x_2=2x_3+x_4</m>, or
        <me>
          2x_2-2x_3-x_4=0
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We put these equations into an augmented matrix and then reduced row echelon form.
        <me>
            \begin{bmatrix} 1\amp 0 \amp -1\amp 0\amp 0\\2\amp 0 \amp 0\amp -2\amp 0\\0\amp 2\amp -2\amp -1\amp 0\\ \end{bmatrix} \rrefarrow \begin{bmatrix} 1\amp 0\amp 0\amp -1 \amp 0\\0\amp 1\amp 0\amp \frac{-5}{2}\amp 0\\0\amp 0\amp 1\amp -2 \amp 0\\ \end{bmatrix}
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that the variable <m>x_4</m> is free, which means that mathematically, <m>x_4</m> can take on any value.  What happens if we let 
        <m>x_4=1</m>?  The third row says that <m>x_3-2x_4=0</m>, which means that <m>x_3=2</m>.  The second row says that
        <m>x_2-\frac{5}{2}x_4=0</m>, which means that <m>x_2=\frac{5}{2}</m>, and the first row says that <m>x_1-x_4=0</m>,
        which means that <m>x_1=1</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, it is impossible to have a fractional number of molecules.  To clear the denominator, let's multiply by <m>2</m> and let
        <m>x_4=2</m> instead of <m>1</m>.  Then the particular solution becomes
        <md>
          <mrow>x_1 \amp =2 </mrow>
          <mrow>x_2 \amp =5 </mrow>
          <mrow>x_3 \amp =4 </mrow>
          <mrow>x_4 \amp =2 </mrow>
        </md>
        and the balanced equation is 
        <me>
          2 C_2H_2 + 5 O_2 \longrightarrow 4 CO_2 + 2 H_2 O
        </me>.
        Note that it makes sense to have infinitely many solutions to the linear system, since multiplying the 
        whole thing by <m>2</m> or <m>5</m> or any whole positive number will make sense and keep the 
        reaction balanced with equal numbers of each element's atoms before and after the arrow.
      </p>
    </example>

    <!-- do an interactive?  asking about how many atoms are on the left vs the right?  what equation 
     arises? or move on to an interactive or series of interactive questions involving a sports example or a polynomial?
     could also do a parsons on the problem solving steps, maybe for a specific example.  
     I think I like doing a parsons for the last "example" problem type.  -->
