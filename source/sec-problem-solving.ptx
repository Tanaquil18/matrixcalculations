  <title>Problem Solving with Linear Systems</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
        Most of the problems we've seen so far have started with a given linear system, and we learned how
        to find the solution(s) to the system by performing Gauss-Jordan elimination and interpreting the 
        resulting reduced row echelon form. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In this section, we will consider problems where the linear system is <q>hidden</q>, that is, not stated in the problem.
        We will create a linear system to solve the problem, and we will also need to interpret the possible solution(s)
         in terms of the context of the question, where it's possible that not all values of the variables make sense.
    </p>
  </introduction>

  <subsection xml:id="subsec-problem-solving-bc">
    <title>Prepare</title>
    <p>
        Let's start with an example.   
    </p>
    <example xml:id="ex_application_1"><title>Seats in a Baseball Stadium</title>
        <p>
            A baseball stadium has seating arranged in three sections. As part of a special promotion, guests will receive 
            two of three prizes. Guests seated in Sections A and B will receive a hat, guests seated in Sections B and C will 
            receive a shirt, and guests seated in Sections A and C will receive a hot dog. The promoters told the stadium managers 
            of their plans, and asked how many seats were in each section. 
            The managers, thinking they were being helpful, told the promoters they would need <m>800</m> hats, <m>608</m> shirts,
            and <m>612</m> hot dogs, and they have since been unavailable for further help. How many seats are in each section?
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to answer this question, we need to make we know what is being asked.
            The final sentence of the question asks: <q>How many seats are in each section?</q>
        </p>
        <p>
            Since we are trying to solve for the number of seats in each section, those should be our variables.
            Let <m>x_1</m> be the number of seats in Section A, <m>x_2</m> be the number of seats in Section B,
             and <m>x_3</m> be the number of seats in Section C.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now we use the information given to create linear equations. We were told that hats go to guests 
            in Sections A and B and that we'll need <m>800</m> hats, which means that
            <me>
            x_1+x_2 = 800.
            </me>
            Guests in Sections B and C get shirts, which means that 
            <me>
              x_2+x_3 = 608
            </me>.
            Lastly, guests in Sections A and C get hot dogs, which means that
            <me>
              x_1+x_3 = 612
            </me>.
            Putting these three equations into a linear system results in
            <md>
            <mrow> \amp x_1\amp \amp +  \amp \amp x_2\amp \amp \amp \amp \amp \amp = 800 </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp \amp \amp \amp \amp x_2\amp  \amp +\amp   \amp x_3\amp \amp = 608 </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp x_1  \amp \amp +\amp  \amp \amp  \amp \amp  \amp x_3\amp \amp =612 </mrow>
            </md>,
            and the corresponding augmented matrix is
            <me>
            \left[\begin{array}{cccc} 1\amp 1\amp 0\amp 800\\0\amp 1\amp 1\amp 608\\1\amp 0\amp 1\amp 612\\ \end{array} \right]
            </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
            To solve our system,
            we put the augmented matrix into reduced row echelon form and get
            <me>
            \left[\begin{array}{cccc} 1\amp 1\amp 0\amp 800\\0\amp 1\amp 1\amp 608\\1\amp 0\amp 1\amp 612\\ \end{array} \right] \rrefarrow \left[\begin{array}{cccc} 1\amp 0\amp 0\amp 402\\0\amp 1\amp 0\amp 398\\0\amp 0\amp 1\amp 210\\ \end{array} \right]
            </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since <m>x_1=402</m>, this means that Section A has <m>402</m> seats.
            Similarly, we see that Section B has <m>398</m> seats, and Section C has <m>210</m> seats. 
            This is a reasonable solution because the number of seats in each section is 
            nonnegative and a whole number. 
        </p>
    </example>
    <p>
      Let's recap and generalize our steps.
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            We made sure we knew what the problem was asking. (<q>How many seats in each section?</q>)
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            We gave variable names to the unknown number of seats in each section. 
            (Section A had <m>x_1</m> number of seats, Section B had <m>x_2</m>, and Section C had 
            <m>x_3</m> many seats.)
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            We used the information given in the problem to write down linear equations involving those variables.  
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            We constructed an augmented matrix from the system of linear equations and put the matrix into reduced row echelon form.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            We made sure the solution obtained from the reduced row echelon form made sense in the context of the problem.  
            (The number of seats in a section couldn't have been a negative or fractional number like <m>-4.78</m>, for example.)
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>This set of problem-solving steps is important enough to say again.</p>

      <title>An example with points scoring in football</title>
      <p>
        The most common ways to score points in an American football game are by touchdowns, extra points,
        2-point conversions, and field goals.  
        Touchdowns are worth <m>6</m> points and are immediately followed by either an extra point worth <m>1</m> point 
        or by a 2-point conversion worth <m>2</m> points.  Field goals are worth <m>3</m> points.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Suppose that in one game a team had <m>7</m> scoring plays and scored a total of <m>24</m> points.  Each touchdown
        was followed by a successful extra point or 2-point conversion.  How did the team score their points?
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's go through our problem-solving steps.  We are asked to find how the team scored their points,
        which means how many touchdowns, extra points, 2-point conversions, and field goals the team had.

      <example><title>Points in a Football Game</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        In a football game,
        teams can score points through touchdowns worth 6 points,
        extra points
        (that follow touchdowns)
        worth <m>1</m> point, two point conversions
        (that also follow touchdowns)
        worth <m>2</m> points and field goals, worth <m>3</m> points.
        You are told that in a football game,
        the two competing teams scored on <m>7</m> occasions,
        giving a total score of <m>24</m> points.
        Each touchdown was followed by either a successful extra point or two point conversion.
        In what ways were these points scored?
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        The question asks how the points were scored;
        we can interpret this as asking how many touchdowns,
        extra points, two point conversions and field goals were scored.
        We'll need to assign variable names to our unknowns;
        let <m>t</m> represent the number of touchdowns scored; let <m>x</m> represent the number of extra points scored,
        let <m>w</m> represent the number of two point conversions,
        and let <m>f</m> represent the number of field goals scored.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now we address the issue of writing equations with these variables using the given information.
        Since we have a total of <m>7</m> scoring occasions, we know that
        <me>
          t+x+w+f=7
        </me>.
        The total points scored is <m>24</m>; considering the value of each type of scoring opportunity,
        we can write the equation
        <me>
          6t+x+2w+3f = 24
        </me>.
        Finally, we know that each touchdown was followed by a successful extra point or two point conversion.
        This is subtle,
        but it tells us that the number of touchdowns is equal to the sum of extra points and two point conversions.
        In other words,
        <me>
          t = x+w
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        To solve our problem,
        we put these equations into a matrix and put the matrix into reduced row echelon form.
        Doing so, we find
        <me>
          \left[\begin{array}{ccccc} 1\amp 1\amp 1\amp 1\amp 7\\ 6\amp 1\amp 2\amp 3\amp 24\\1\amp -1\amp -1\amp 0\amp 0\\ \end{array} \right] \rrefarrow \left[\begin{array}{ccccc}  1\amp 0\amp 0\amp 0.5\amp 3.5\\0\amp 1\amp 0\amp 1\amp 4\\ 0\amp 0\amp 1\amp -0.5\amp -0.5\\ \end{array} \right]
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, we know that
        <md>
          <mrow>t \amp =3.5-0.5f</mrow>
          <mrow>x\amp =4-f</mrow>
          <mrow>w\amp =-0.5+0.5f</mrow>
        </md>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We recognize that this means there are
        <q>infinite solutions,</q>
        but of course most of these will not make sense in the context of a real football game.
        We must apply some logic to make sense of the situation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Progressing in no particular order,
        consider the second equation, <m>x = 4-f</m>.
        In order for us to have a positive number of extra points,
        we must have <m>f\leq 4</m>.
        (And of course, we need <m>f\geq 0</m>, too.)
        Therefore, right away we know we have a total of only <m>5</m> possibilities,
        where <m>f = 0</m>, <m>1</m>,
        <m>2</m>, <m>3</m> or <m>4</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the first and third equations,
        we see that if <m>f</m> is an even number,
        then <m>t</m> and <m>w</m> will both be fractions
        (for instance, if <m>f=0</m>, then <m>t = 3.5</m>)
        which does not make sense.
        Therefore, we are down to two possible solutions,
        <m>f = 1</m> and <m>f=3</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If <m>f=1</m>, we have <m>3</m> touchdowns, <m>3</m> extra points,
        no two point conversions, and (of course), <m>1</m> field goal. (Check to make sure that gives <m>24</m> points!) If <m>f=3</m>,
        then we have <m>2</m> touchdowns, <m>1</m> extra point, <m>1</m> two point conversion, and (of course) <m>3</m> field goals.
        Again, check to make sure this gives us <m>24</m> points.
        Also, we should check each solution to make sure that we have a total of <m>7</m> scoring occasions and that each touchdown could be followed by an extra point or a two point conversion.
      </p>

    <p>
      Not all applications of linear systems are sports-related.  Let's do another example, one which involves balancing a chemical equation.
      <fn>All chemical reaction problems found in this text are thanks to Gregory Bard and Gergely Sirokman.</fn> 
    </p>
    <example xml:id="ex_balance_chem_eqn"><title>Balancing a chemical equation</title>
      <p>
        When chemicals react, no elements are created or destroyed; instead they recombine into different substances.  
        For example, a blow torch works by burning acetylene <m>C_2H_2</m> in the presence of oxygen <m>O_2</m>.  The result is carbon
        dioxide <m>CO_2</m> and water <m>H_2 O</m>. 
        <me>
          \text{acetylene } + \text{ oxygen } \longrightarrow \text{ carbon dioxide } + \text{ water}
        </me>
        If there were <m>4</m> atoms of carbon (as part of the acetylene)
        before the reaction, then there have to be <m>4</m> atoms of carbon (in the form of carbon dioxide) after the reaction also.  
      </p>
      <p>
        In chemistry, balancing a chemical equation means finding the smallest numbers of the different molecules involved in the reaction. 
        Most students of chemistry balance equations by guessing and checking, but there's actually a system of linear equations involved, 
        which means there's an algorithm which always leads to a solution.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's balance the blow torch reaction, using our problem solving steps.
        <me>
          <fillin characters="1"/>C_2H_2 + <fillin characters="1" />O_2 \longrightarrow <fillin characters="1" /> CO_2 + <fillin characters="1" />H_2O
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        We need to find the coefficients of each of the molecules, so those are the unknowns we should give names to.  Let's say there are
        <m>x_1</m> many molecules of <m>C_2H_2</m>, and <m>x_2</m> many molecules of <m>O_2</m>, and
         <m>x_3</m> many molecules of <m>CO_2</m>, and <m>x_4</m> many molecules of <m>H_2O</m>.
         <me>
          x_1 \, C_2H_2 + x_2 \, O_2 \longrightarrow x_3 \, CO_2 + x_4 \, H_2O
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        Now we consider each element and the number of atoms there are before and after the reaction.  
      </p>
      <p>
        For carbon, which is denoted by <m>C</m>,
        there are <m>x_1</m> molecules of <m>C_2H_2</m>, and there are <m>2</m> carbon atoms in each of the <m>x_1</m>
        molecules, which means there are <m>2x_1</m> carbon atoms before the reaction takes place.  After the reaction 
        (or after the arrow), there are <m>x_3</m> molecules of <m>CO_2</m> and <m>1</m> carbon atom in each molecule, which means
        there are <m>x_3</m> many atoms of carbon after the reaction occurs.  
        Because the number of carbon atoms must be the same before and after the reaction, we get the equation <m>2x_1=x_3</m>, 
        or restated in the form which has the constant after the equal sign as
        <me>
          2x_1-x_3=0
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next, we examine hydrogen, which is denoted by <m>H</m>. Before the reaction there were <m>2</m> hydrogen atoms in each of
        the <m>x_1</m> molecules of <m>C_2H_2</m>, for a total of <m>2x_1</m> hydrogen atoms. 
        After the reaction, there are <m>2</m> hydrogen atoms in each of the <m>x_4</m> molecules of <m>H_2O</m>, for a total of <m>2x_4</m> 
        hydrogen atoms.  This gives the equation <m>2x_1=2x_4</m>, or moving the variables to the left side of the equal sign,
        <me>
          2x_1-2x_4=0
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, we look at oxygen, denoted by <m>O</m>.  Note that there is oxygen in both of the molecules that appear after the reaction.  
        There were <m>2x_2</m> oxygen atoms before the reaction took place, and after the reaction there are 
        <m>2</m> oxygen atoms in each of the <m>x_3</m> molecules of <m>CO_2</m> and <m>1</m> oxygen atom in each of
        the <m>x_4</m> molecules of <m>H_2O</m>, which means there is a total of
        <m>2x_3+x_4</m> oxygen atoms after the reaction.  This gives us the equation <m>2x_2=2x_3+x_4</m>, or
        <me>
          2x_2-2x_3-x_4=0
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We put these equations into an augmented matrix and then reduced row echelon form.

        Note that the variable <m>x_4</m> is free, which means that mathematically, <m>x_4</m> can take on any value.  What happens if we let 
        <m>x_4=1</m>?  The third row says that <m>x_3-2x_4=0</m>, which means that <m>x_3=2</m>.  The second row says that
        <m>x_2-\frac{5}{2}x_4=0</m>, which means that <m>x_2=\frac{5}{2}</m>, and the first row says that <m>x_1-x_4=0</m>,
        which means that <m>x_1=1</m>.

        However, it is impossible to have a fractional number of molecules.  To clear the denominator, let's multiply by <m>2</m> and let
        <m>x_4=2</m> instead of <m>1</m>.  Then the particular solution becomes
        <md>
          <mrow>x_1 \amp =2 </mrow>
          <mrow>x_2 \amp =5 </mrow>

        and the balanced equation is 
        <me>
          2 C_2H_2 + 5 O_2 \longrightarrow 4 CO_2 + 2 H_2 O
        </me>.
        Note that it makes sense to have infinitely many solutions to the linear system, since multiplying the 
        whole thing by <m>2</m> or <m>5</m> or any whole positive number will keep the 
        reaction balanced with equal numbers of each element's atoms before and after the arrow.
      </p>
    </example>

    <!-- do an interactive?  asking about how many atoms are on the left vs the right?  what equation 
     arises? or move on to an interactive or series of interactive questions involving a sports example or a polynomial?
     could also do a parsons on the problem solving steps, maybe for a specific example.  
     I think I like doing a parsons for the last "example" problem type. do a sports problem and a polynomial problem. -->

        <statement>

            Select the correct steps to find the equation of the quadratic function that goes through the points <m>(-1,6)</m>, <m>(1,2)</m>

              distractor: x, y, a, b, c, are all unknowns
              Going through the point (-1,6) means x=-1 and y=6, so 6=a(-1)^2+b(-1)+c
              Similarly for the two remaining points we get 2=a(1)^2+b(1)+c and 3=a(2)^2+b(2)+c
              equations are a-b+c=6, a+b+c=2 and 4a+2b+c=3
