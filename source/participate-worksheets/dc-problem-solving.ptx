                Suppose we know that in a football game there were <m>24</m> points scored from <m>8</m> scoring occasions
                and also that the number of successful extra point kicks was equal to the number of successful two point conversions.
                Find all ways in which the points may have been scored in this game.
            </p>
          </statement>
          <answer>
              <p>
                The only way which meets all the conditions and makes sense is by scoring <m>8</m> field goals. 
              </p>
          </answer>
          <solution>
            <p>
                The augmented matrix from this system is <m>\left[\begin{array}{ccccc} 1\amp 1\amp 1\amp 1\amp 8\\6\amp 1\amp 2\amp 3\amp 24\\0\amp 1\amp -1\amp 0\amp 0\\ \end{array} \right]</m>.
                From this we find the solution
                <md>
                <mrow>t\amp =\frac83-\frac13f</mrow>
                <mrow>x\amp =\frac83-\frac13f</mrow>
                <mrow>c\amp =\frac83-\frac13f</mrow>
                </md>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The only time each of these variables are nonnegative integers is when <m>f=2</m> or <m>f=8</m>.
                If <m>f=2</m>,
                then we have <m>2</m> touchdowns, <m>2</m> extra points and <m>2</m> two point conversions (and <m>2</m> field goals);
                this doesn't make sense since the extra points and two point conversions follow touchdowns.
                If <m>f=8</m>, then we have no touchdowns,
                extra points or two point conversions
                (just <m>8</m> field goals).
                This is the only solution; all points were scored from field goals.

              You might know that two points determine a line. That's because in a line <m>y=mx+b</m> there are two unknowns: 
              the coefficient of the <m>x</m> term and the constant term.  Note that in <xref ref="parsons-quadratic-through-3-pts"/> 
              we needed three points to determine a specific quadratic function because there were three unknowns: 
              the coefficient of the <m>x^2</m> term, the coefficient of the <m>x</m> term and the coefficient of the constant term.
