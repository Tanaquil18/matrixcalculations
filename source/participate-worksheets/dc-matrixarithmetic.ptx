      <introduction>
        <p>
          We have discussed multiplying a matrix by a number.  Most texts (and possibly your instructor) will use the term <term>scalar</term>
          instead of <q>number</q>.  There are good reasons for this, but they are outside the scope of this material.  
          Still, it would be good to recognize both words.

          <statement>
            <p>
              Consider the matrices <m>A=\begin{bmatrix}1 \amp 2 \amp 3 \end{bmatrix}</m> and <m>B=\begin{bmatrix} 1\\ 2 \\ 3 \end{bmatrix}</m>. 
          Say why <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are not equal as matrix objects.  Does this make sense to you, or do you think
          they should be the same thing?
            </p>
          </statement>
          <answer>
            <p>
              They are not the same size, so they can't be equal as matrices.  However, they contain the exact same 
              information and the only difference is the orientation of the writing.

              A square matrix is <m>n\times n</m>, same number of rows as columns.  A row matrix is <m>1\times n</m>, written
              as one row, while a column matrix is <m>n\times 1</m>, written as one column.

              Insufficient Information.  Note that these are all statements you might be used to thinking about with 
              numbers, and the goal is to think about how matrices and numbers are similar in some ways and different in some ways.
