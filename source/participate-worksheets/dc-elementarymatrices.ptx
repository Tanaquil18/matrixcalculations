              The theorem containing various things equivalent to the property of being invertible is sometimes called <q>The Invertible Matrix Theorem</q>.
              But the star of the show is really the property of the reduced row echelon form of 
              <m>A</m> being <m>I</m>.  Let's explore a bit how some of the various properties are related.

              <p>
                Suppose you know that <m>A</m> is an <m>n\times n</m> matrix whose reduced row echelon form is <m>I</m>.  
                Set up the augmented matrix <m>\big[A | I \big]</m>.  What happens after you row reduce this matrix?
                What does mean for the invertibility of <m>A</m>?

                Now we know that performing a row operation is the same as multiplying by an elementary matrix.  Performing a row operation on
                <m>\big[A | I \big]</m> has the same result as <m>\big[E_1A | E_1I \big]</m>. The reduced row echelon form of <m>A</m>
                being <m>I</m> means that there is a sequence of elementary matrices <m>E_1, E_2, \ldots E_m</m> such that
