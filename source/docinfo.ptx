  <!-- It is possible to rename elements: -->
  <!-- <rename element="assemblage" xml:lang="en-US">Summary</rename> -->
  <rename element="inlineexercise">Activity</rename>
  <rename element="activity">Exercise</rename>
  <!-- I know the above renaming seems idiotic, but I have two sets of what are really 
   post-section exercises, one where I'm okay if the answers are showing (the divisional one, with non-interactive problems) and one 
   that's not showing answers (containing interactive problems).  That difference in behavior means that the two sets of 
   problems have to be a different division type and/or exercise type.  I know webwork works within activity on Runestone, so that's what I've chosen to use. 
   As a bonus commpanying this choice, activity has its own numbering, so as long as I use activity-like only for this purpose, the end-of-section webwork
   are numbered starting at chap.sec.1. Also, I use a lot of runestone interactives inline that I would like to be called Activity, but as of this 
   writing, pretext has perhaps tacitly assumed that all runestone directives are exercise elements, especially fillin. -->
