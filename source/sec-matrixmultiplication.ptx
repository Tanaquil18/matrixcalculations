  <title>Matrix Multiplication</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
        Last section, we learned how to add and subtract matrices of the same size and 
        how to multiply a matrix by a number.  In this section, we learn how to multiply 
        two matrices together, when matrix multiplication can be performed.

    <p>
        Matrices of the same size are added by adding corresponding entries together, but
        we do <em>not</em> multiply matrices by multiplying corresponding entries together.  
        This is confusing at first, but there are very good reasons for defining matrix 
        multiplication differently.  Unfortunately, most of those reasons do not become 
        understandable until much, much later.
    </p>
    <p>
      To start, two matrices can be multiplied together only if <em>the number of columns in the 
      first matrix equals the number of rows in the second matrix</em>.  This means that a 
      <m>2\times 3</m> matrix can be multiplied by a <m>3\times 1</m> matrix, or a <m>3\times 2</m> matrix,
      or a <m>3\times 3</m> or <m>3\times 4</m> etc. matrix, but a <m>2\times 3</m> matrix 
      <em>cannot</em> be multiplied by another <m>2\times 3</m> matrix.  
    </p>
    <p>
      That's already pretty surprising, so let's check our understanding.
