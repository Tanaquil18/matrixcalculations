  <title>Matrix Multiplication</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
        Last section, we learned how to add and subtract matrices of the same size and 
        how to multiply a matrix by a number.  In this section, we learn when matrix multiplication
        can be performed and how to multiply two matrices together. 
    </p>
  </introduction>

    <p>
        Matrices of the same size are added by adding corresponding entries together, but
        we do <em>not</em> multiply matrices by multiplying corresponding entries together.  
        This is confusing at first, but there are very good reasons for defining matrix 
        multiplication differently.  Unfortunately, most of those reasons do not become 
        understandable until much, much later.
    </p>
    <p>
      To start, two matrices can be multiplied together only if <em>the number of columns in the 
      first matrix equals the number of rows in the second matrix</em>.  This means that a 
      <m>2\times 3</m> matrix can be multiplied by a <m>3\times 1</m> matrix, or a <m>3\times 2</m> matrix,
      or a <m>3\times 3</m> or <m>3\times 4</m> etc. matrix, but a <m>2\times 3</m> matrix 
      <em>cannot</em> be multiplied by another <m>2\times 3</m> matrix.  
    </p>
    <p>
      That's already pretty surprising, so let's check our understanding.

    <p>
      To start to understand why the number of columns of the first 
      matrix must equal the number of rows of the second matrix, we demonstrate how to multiply a 
      <m>3\times 2</m> matrix by a <m>2\times 1</m> matrix.

    <example xml:id="ex_matrixbycolumn"><title>Multiplying on the right by a column matrix</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
        Suppose we have the matrices <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> below:
        <me>
          A = \left[\begin{array}{rr}
          -2 \amp 3 \\
          0 \amp 2 \\
          3 \amp 1 \\
          \end{array}\right],~~~
          B = \left[\begin{array}{r}
          2 \\ 3 \\ \end{array}\right]
        </me>.
        Their product is defined by multiplying the first column of <m>A</m> by 
        the first number in <m>B</m>, and multiplying the second column of <m>A</m> by the second 
        number in <m>B</m>, and adding the results.
        <me>
          \begin{aligned}
          AB = 
          \left[\begin{array}{rr}
          -2 \amp 3 \\
          0 \amp 2 \\
          3 \amp 1 \\
          \end{array}\right]
          \left[\begin{array}{r} 2 \\ 3 \\ \end{array}\right]
          {}={} \amp
          \left[\begin{array}{r} -2 \\ 0 \\ 3 \\ \end{array}\right]2 +
           \left[\begin{array}{r} 3 \\ 2 \\ 1 \\ \end{array}\right]3
          \\ \\
          {}={} \amp
          \left[\begin{array}{r} -2\cdot 2 \\ 0\cdot 2 \\ 3\cdot 2 \\ \end{array}\right] +
          \left[\begin{array}{r} 3\cdot 3 \\ 2\cdot 3 \\ 1\cdot 3 \\ \end{array}\right] \\ \\
          {}={} \amp
          \left[\begin{array}{r} 5 \\ 6 \\ 9 \\ \end{array}\right]. \\
          \end{aligned}
        </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          If we look at the first entry, we see it came from
          <me>
            -2\cdot 2 + 3 \cdot 3
          </me>,
          and we note that the first row of <m>A</m> is <m>\begin{bmatrix} -2 \amp 3 \end{bmatrix}</m>.
          Looking at the second entry of <m>AB</m> we have 
          <me>
            0\cdot 2 + 2 \cdot 3
          </me>,
          and the second row of <m>A</m> is <m>\begin{bmatrix} 0 \amp 2 \end{bmatrix}</m>.
          The third entry of <m>AB</m> is
          <me>
            3\cdot 2 + 1 \cdot 3
          </me>, 
          and the third row of <m>A</m> is <m>\begin{bmatrix} 3 \amp 1 \end{bmatrix}</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This means that we can view matrix multiplication entry-wise as 
          multiplying the numbers in a row of the first matrix by the numbers in a column of the second matrix and adding them up.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      Note that in <xref ref="ex_matrixbycolumn"/> the matrix <m>A</m> has two columns and so we
      needed <m>B</m> to contain two numbers in its column, which means <m>B</m> has two rows.  
      On the other hand, since <m>A</m> has three rows, the result of multiplying a column of <m>A</m> 
      by a number still has three rows, and adding matrices keeps the size the same, which is why the 
      product <m>AB</m> has three rows.
    </p>
    <p>
      This generalizes to when the second matrix of the product has more columns than <m>1</m>.

          </me>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Let's call the first matrix <m>A</m> and the second matrix <m>B</m>. We should first check to see that we can actually perform this multiplication.
          Matrix <m>A</m> is <m>2\times 2</m> and <m>B</m> is <m>2\times 3</m>.
          The <q>inner</q>
          dimensions match up, so we can compute the product; the
          <q>outer</q>
          dimensions tell us that the product will be <m>2\times 3</m>.
          We form a <m>2\times 3</m> matrix
          <me>
            A B = \left[\begin{array}{ccc} m_{11} \amp  m_{12} \amp  m_{13}\\m_{21} \amp  m_{22} \amp  m_{23} \end{array} \right]
          </me>,
          and we will now find the value of each of the entries.
        </p>
        <p>
          The entry <m>m_{11}</m> is in the first row and first column, so
          we use the first row of <m>A</m> and the first column of <m>B</m>, multiply corresponding number entries and add them up. Thus
          <me>
            m_{11} = \left[\begin{array}{cc}  1\amp 2 \end{array} \right]\left[\begin{array}{c} 3\\1 \end{array} \right] = 1\cdot 3+2 \cdot 1 = 5
          </me>.
          We now know that
          <me>
            A B = \left[\begin{array}{ccc} 5 \amp  m_{12} \amp  m_{13}\\m_{21} \amp  m_{22} \amp  m_{23} \end{array} \right]
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Moving to the next entry to the right, we use the the first row of <m>A</m> and the second column of <m>B</m>, giving us
          <me>
            m_{12} = \left[\begin{array}{cc} 1\amp 2 \end{array} \right]\left[\begin{array}{c} -1\\2 \end{array} \right] = 1\cdot(-1)+2\cdot 2 = 3
          </me>.
          Finishing the first row of <m>AB</m>, using the first row of <m>A</m> and the third column of B, we get
          <me>
            m_{13} = \left[\begin{array}{cc} 1\amp 2 \end{array} \right]\left[\begin{array}{c} 0\\-1 \end{array} \right] = 1\cdot 0+2\cdot (-1) = -2
          </me>. 
          So far we have
          <me>
            A B = \left[\begin{array}{ccc} 5 \amp  3 \amp  -2\\m_{21} \amp  m_{22} \amp  m_{23} \end{array} \right]
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          To compute the second row of <m>A B</m>, we use the second row of <m>A</m> with the first, then second, and finally third columns of <m>B</m>.
          We find
          <me>
            m_{21} = \left[\begin{array}{cc} 3\amp 4 \end{array} \right]\left[\begin{array}{c} 3\\1 \end{array} \right] = 13
          </me>
          <me>
            m_{22} = \left[\begin{array}{cc} 3\amp 4 \end{array} \right]\left[\begin{array}{c} -1\\2 \end{array} \right] = 5
          </me>,
          and
          <me>
            m_{23} = \left[\begin{array}{cc} 3\amp 4 \end{array} \right]\left[\begin{array}{c} 0\\-1 \end{array} \right] = -4
          </me>.
          Thus
          <me>
            A B = \left[\begin{array}{cc} 1\amp 2\\3\amp 4 \end{array} \right]\left[\begin{array}{ccc} 1\amp -1\amp 0\\2\amp 2\amp -1 \end{array} \right] = \left[\begin{array}{ccc} 5 \amp  3 \amp  -2\\13 \amp  5 \amp  -4 \end{array} \right]
          </me>
        </p>

            Enter a response to both of the following tasks:
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Ask a question about the material, either about something you're not sure you fully understand, 
                  or a <q>what if</q> question.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Give a percentage from 0 to 100 that reflects how confident you are with the material you 
                  just read about, and give one sentence as to why you feel that way.  0 means you didn't 
                  actually do the reading and 100 means that everything makes sense so far and you think you are 
                  completely ready to engage with the material more deeply.  
                </p>
              </li>
            </ol>
          </p>
        </statement>
        <response/>
      </exercise>
