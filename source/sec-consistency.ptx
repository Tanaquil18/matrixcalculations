  <title>Consistent and Inconsistent Systems</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      We've learned how to take a linear system, turn it into an augmented matrix, and use Gauss-Jordan
      elimination to put the matrix into reduced row echelon form.  We used the reduced row echelon form to see what the solution was 
      to the original linear system, and in all the examples we've seen so far, there was exactly one solution.
    </p>
    <p> 
      In this section, we consider different possibilities for what the solutions to a linear system can be and
        see how we can identify those different possibilities from the reduced row echelon form that results
        after performing Gauss-Jordan elimination.

      In <xref ref="ex-fruitpuzzle"/>, <xref ref="ex_sony_interview"/>, <xref ref="ex_by_hand"/>, <xref ref="ex_eq_mat"/>,
      and all of our other examples of linear systems, there was exactly one solution, that is, one possible assignment
      of values to the variables which made all of the equations in the system true at the same time. We now consider if 
      that is always the case or not.

        First, consider the following linear system with one equation:
        <me>
          x-y=0
        </me>.
        This equation is true whenever <m>x=y</m>.  We can picture 
        all of the possible solutions by thinking of the graph of the equation <m>y=x</m>.
      </p>

    </sidebyside>

    <p>
      Each single equation with two variables can be viewed in this way, as a line in the plane.
      Let's now consider systems of linear equations with two equations and two variables, 
      so that there are two lines in the plane.
    </p> 
    <sidebyside widths="50% 45%" margins="0%">
      <p>
        Consider the linear system
        <md>
          <mrow>x-y\amp =0</mrow>
          <mrow>x+y\amp =2</mrow>
        </md>.
        Since each equation can be viewed as a line and since the slopes of the lines are different,
        we know the lines will intersect somewhere, and that point of intersection is the only solution to the system. 
      </p>

    <sidebyside widths="50% 45%" margins="0%">
      <p>
        Now consider the linear system

          <mrow>x-y\amp =0</mrow>
          <mrow>2x-2y\amp =0</mrow>
        </md>.
        While this system has two equations, the second is a multiple of the first.
        The thicker line is used to represent that we've drawn the same line twice.
        In this case, we have an infinite solution set,
      just as if we only had the one equation <m>x-y=0</m>.

        Finally, consider the linear system

          <mrow>x-y\amp =0</mrow>
          <mrow>x-y\amp =2</mrow>
        </md>.
    
        If the difference between <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> is <m>0</m>, it can't also be <m>2</m>. 
        This linear system has no solution. We observe that the two lines are parallel and never intersect.

      It becomes harder to visualize when we add variables, but
      no matter how many equations and variables we have,
      solutions to linear equations always come in one of three forms:
      exactly one solution, infinite solutions, or no solution.
      This is a fact that we will not prove here,
      but it deserves to be stated.

    <title>Determining Consistency</title>
    <p>
      How can we tell whether a given system of linear equations has <m>0</m>, <m>1</m>, or infinitely many solutions?
      The answer to this question lies with the reduced row echelon form of its 
      corresponding augmented matrix.
    </p>
    <remark><title>A note on using technology</title>
      <p>
      When we are learning a new technique or procedure, it's good to go through all the steps ourselves because understanding the 
      process has benefits.  That's why we typically learn how to add
      numbers using manipulatives like blocks or fingers, with the goal of eventually being able to add faster without any aids; 
      in fact, we eventually add numbers we never could have represented with physical manipulatives. The focus shifted from the 
      ability to add for its own sake to solving a problem which required addition as a step.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a similar way, once we are able to perform Gauss-Jordan elimination by hand for small systems, 
        we move to using technology to quickly obtain the reduced row echelon form of a matrix.  The focus 
        is no longer on our ability to row reduce for its own sake but on answering a question which 
        requires interpreting the result of row reducing a matrix.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are many apps, websites, etc., which can produce the reduced row echelon form
        of a matrix very quickly.  This book will use SageMath, a language which is built on Python and free.  
        Hit the <q>Evaluate (Sage)</q> button below to see both the matrix and its reduced row echelon form.
      </p>
      <sage>
          <input>
              A=matrix(QQ,2,3,[[1,2,3],[4,5,6]])
              show(A,"-->",A.rref())
          </input>
      </sage>

      <p>
        The <q>QQ</q> in the Sage cell above is present for a technical reason, and the rest of syntax means
        that <m>A</m> is being defined as a <m>2\times 3</m> matrix, whose first row is <m>[1, 2, 3]</m> and
        whose second row is <m>[4,5,6]</m>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Try modifying the contents of the above Sage cell to calculate the reduced row echelon form of a different matrix.
        Don't worry about messing anything up beyond repair; refreshing the page will reset the Sage cell back to its initial state.
      </p>
      <p>
        From now on, we will give the reduced row echelon form of the matrix without showing work.
      </p>
    </remark>
    
    <p>
      We begin by distinguishing between systems which have a solution (either one or infinitely many) 
      and those which have no solution.

          if it does not have a solution.

      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>
      What happens in the reduced row echelon form if a linear system has no solutions?
    </p>

    <example xml:id="ex_ex_un_2">
        <title>A system with no solutions</title>
        <p>
          Find the solution to the linear system
          <me>
            \begin{array}{ccccccc} x_1\amp +\amp x_2\amp +\amp x_3\amp =\amp 1\\ x_1\amp +\amp 2x_2\amp +\amp x_3\amp =\amp 2\\ 2x_1\amp +\amp 3x_2\amp +\amp 2x_3\amp =\amp 0 \end{array}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Answer:</em> We put the corresponding augmented matrix into reduced row echelon form.
          <me>
            \left[\begin{array}{cccc}  1\amp 1\amp 1\amp 1\\1\amp 2\amp 1\amp 2\\ 2\amp 3\amp 2\amp 0\\ \end{array} \right] \rrefarrow \left[\begin{array}{cccc}  1\amp 0\amp 1\amp 0\\ 0\amp 1\amp 0\amp 0\\ 0\amp 0\amp 0\amp 1\\ \end{array} \right]
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Now let us take the reduced matrix and write out the corresponding equations.
          The first two rows give us the equations
          <md>
            <mrow>x_1+x_3\amp =0</mrow>
            <mrow>x_2 \amp = 0</mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>
        <p>
          So far, so good.
          However the last row gives us the equation
          <me>
            0x_1+0x_2+0x_3 = 1
          </me>.
          There are no values of <m>x_1, x_2</m> and <m>x_3</m> which can make <m>0=1</m>.
          Therefore, no solution exists, and 
          this system is inconsistent.
        </p>
    </example>
    <p>
      The key takeaway from <xref ref="ex_ex_un_2"/> is: if any row has a leading <m>1</m> in the last column after 
      row reducing the augmented matrix of a linear system, the system is inconsistent.  
      Otherwise, the system is consistent, which means it has at least 1 solution.

                            There is no common point of intersection.  Each line is an equation, and there is no point which satisfies
                            all three equations.  The linear system pictured has no solution, which means it's inconsistent.

    <p>
      We've now seen a system which has no solution and 
      systems which have exactly one solution such as <xref ref="ex_eq_mat"/>, 
      so let's look next at a system which has infinitely many solutions.
    </p>

  
    <example xml:id="ex_ex_un_1">
      <title>A system with infinitely many solutions</title>
      <p>
        Find the solution to the linear system
        <me>
          \begin{array}{ccccccc} \amp  \amp x_2\amp -\amp x_3\amp =\amp 3\\ x_1\amp   \amp  \amp +\amp 2x_3\amp =\amp 2\\ \amp \amp -3x_2\amp +\amp 3x_3\amp =\amp -9 \end{array}
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Answer:</em> To find the solution,
        put the corresponding matrix into reduced row echelon form.
        <me>
          \left[\begin{array}{cccc}  0\amp 1\amp -1\amp 3\\ 1\amp 0\amp 2\amp 2\\ 0\amp -3\amp 3\amp -9 \end{array} \right] \rrefarrow \left[\begin{array}{cccc} 1\amp 0\amp 2\amp 2\\ 0\amp 1\amp -1\amp 3\\ 0\amp 0\amp 0\amp 0 \end{array} \right]
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        Now convert this reduced matrix back into equations.
        We have
        <md>
          <mrow>x_1 + 2x_3 \amp = 2</mrow>
          <mrow>x_2-x_3\amp =3</mrow>
        </md>.
        We solve for <m>x_1</m> and <m>x_2</m> in terms of <m>x_3</m> and get
        <md>
          <mrow>x_1 \amp = 2-2x_3</mrow>
          <mrow>x_2\amp =3+x_3</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        These two equations tell us that the values of <m>x_1</m> and <m>x_2</m> depend on what <m>x_3</m> is.
        There is no restriction on what <m>x_3</m> must be; it is
        <em>free</em> to take on the value of any real number.
        Since we have infinite choices for the value of <m>x_3</m>,
        we have infinitely many solutions.
      </p>
    </example>
  <!-- could do some multiple choice or multiple select or card sort.  on the right has a linear system,
  on the left has options like consistent or inconsistent, one solution, infinitely many solutions, or no solutions. -->
    <p>
      In the previous example we used the word
      <q>free</q>
      to describe a certain variable.
      What exactly is a free variable?
      How do we recognize which variables are free and which are not?

    <remark>
      <p>
        <xref ref="def_free"/>
        applies only to <em>consistent</em> systems.
        If a system is <em>inconsistent</em>,
        then it's meaningless to talk about being free (or not) to pick
        values for the variables because there are <em>no</em> values which satisfy 
        all the equations in the system.
      </p>
    </remark>
    <p>
      <xref ref="def_free"/> helps us understand when a consistent system of linear equations 
      will have infinitely many solutions.  If a consistent system has no free variables,
      then there is exactly one solution; inversely, if there are any free variables, then there are infinitely many solutions.

          and give two particular solutions.
        </p>
      <!-- </statement>
      <solution> -->
        <p>
          <em>Answer:</em> We can ignore the third row as
          it does not give us any information about the solution.  
          The first and second rows can be rewritten as the following equations:
          <md>
            <mrow>x_1 - x_2 + 2x_4 \amp =4</mrow>
            <mrow>x_3 - 3x_4 \amp = 7</mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Notice how the variables <m>x_1</m> and <m>x_3</m> correspond to the leading <m>1</m>'s of the given matrix.
          Therefore <m>x_1</m> and <m>x_3</m> are dependent variables;
          all other variables, in this case <m>x_2</m> and <m>x_4</m>,
          are free variables.
        </p>
        <p>
          We generally write our solution with the dependent variables on the left and independent variables and constants on the right.
          It is also a good practice to acknowledge the fact that our free variables are,
          in fact, free.
          So all the solutions to the system would look something like
          <md>
            <mrow>x_1 \amp = 4 +x_2 - 2x_4</mrow>
            <mrow>x_2 \amp  \ \ \text{ is free }</mrow>
            <mrow>x_3 \amp = 7+3x_4</mrow>
            <mrow>x_4 \amp  \ \ \text{ is free } </mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>
        <p>
          To find particular solutions,
          choose any values you wish for the free variables.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, by setting <m>x_2 = 0 = x_4</m>, we get:
          <md>
            <mrow>x_1 \amp = 4</mrow>
            <mrow>x_2 \amp =0</mrow>
            <mrow>x_3 \amp = 7</mrow>
            <mrow>x_4 \amp = 0</mrow>
          </md>.
          By setting <m>x_2 = 1</m> and <m>x_4 = -5</m>,
          we have the solution:
          <md>
            <mrow>x_1 \amp = 15</mrow>
            <mrow>x_2 \amp =1</mrow>
            <mrow>x_3 \amp = -8</mrow>
            <mrow>x_4 \amp = -5</mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>
      <!-- </solution> -->
    </example>

    <p>
      The constants and coefficients of an augmented matrix work together to determine whether a given system of linear equations has one,
      infinite, or no solution.
      The coefficients determine whether a matrix will have exactly one solution or not.
      In the <q>or not</q>
      case, the constants determine whether the system has infinite solutions or no solution.

    <title>Summary</title>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
              Every linear system has either no solutions, one solution, or infinitely many solutions. 
              We call a linear system which has at least one solution <em>consistent</em>, and we call
              a linear system with no solutions <em>inconsistent.</em>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
              To analyze how many solutions a given linear system has, we examine the reduced row
              echelon form of the system's augmented matrix. We look for number and location of 
              leading <m>1</m>'s to see whether the system is inconsistent, or in the case that it is consistent, to see which
              variables are <em>free</em> or <em>independent</em> and which variables are <em>basic</em> or <em>dependent</em>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            If a linear system has infinitely many solutions, we can describe all the possible solutions
            by solving for the dependent variables in terms of the free variables, and
              we can also give <em>particular solutions</em> by choosing specific values for the free variables.
