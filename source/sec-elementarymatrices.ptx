  <title>Elementary matrices and invertibility</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
        We have seen how the matrix inverse can be used to solve systems of equations and how 
        systems of equations can arise in many different scenarios and contexts.  The examples we've used
        had only a few unknowns, at most 4 or 5.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, many of the most useful linear systems, in areas like machine learning and data analysis, have tens or 
      hundreds of variables. It becomes very important to maximize efficiency, and the material we are learning now lays
      a foundation for that which will continue to the next section also.
    </p>
  </introduction>

  <subsection xml:id="subsec-elementary-bc">
    <title>Prepare</title>
    <p>
        We'll start by seeing how performing an elementary row operation can be done via matrix multiplication.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="ex-rowops-matrixmult"><title>Row operation and matrix multiplication</title>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Consider the matrix <m>\begin{bmatrix} 1 \amp 2 \\ 3 \amp 5 \end{bmatrix}</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first step in Gauss-Jordan elimination is <m>-3R_1+R_2 \rightarrow R_2</m>, 
                <md>
                  <mrow>\amp \amp \amp \begin{bmatrix} 1 \amp 2 \\ 3 \amp 5 \end{bmatrix}</mrow>
                  <mrow>-3R_1+R_2 \amp\rightarrow R_2 \amp \amp \begin{bmatrix} 1 \amp 2 \\ 0 \amp -1 \end{bmatrix}</mrow>
                </md>.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, we want to perform this row operation by finding a matrix to multiply by <m>A</m>.  If we instead 
                perform that same row operation on the <m>2\times 2</m> identity matrix, we get 
                <md>
                  <mrow>\amp \amp \amp \begin{bmatrix} 1 \amp 0 \\ 0 \amp 1 \end{bmatrix}</mrow>
                  <mrow>-3R_1+R_2 \amp\rightarrow R_2 \amp \amp \begin{bmatrix} 1 \amp 0 \\ -3 \amp 1 \end{bmatrix}</mrow>
                </md>.
                Call this matrix, <m>E_1</m>, so <m>E_1=\begin{bmatrix} 1 \amp 0 \\ -3 \amp 1 \end{bmatrix}</m>.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now check that multiplying <m>E_1</m> by <m>A</m> gives us
                <md>
                    <mrow> E_1A\amp =\begin{bmatrix} 1 \amp 0 \\ -3 \amp 1 \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} 1 \amp 2 \\ 3 \amp 5 \end{bmatrix}</mrow>
                    <mrow> \amp = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \amp 2 \\ 0 \amp -1 \end{bmatrix} </mrow>
                </md>,
                which is the exact same effect as performing <m>-3R_1+R_2\rightarrow R_2</m> on <m>A</m> directly.      
            </p>
        </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
        We just turned an operation on rows of a matrix into a matrix multiplication. 
        You might be wondering, <q>Does this work for other elementary row operations?</q> The answer is, <q>Yes!</q>
        We can turn row operations into matrix multiplication by performing the row operation on the appropriately sized identity matrix.

      There is a name for the kinds of matrices we have been considering.
    </p>

    <definition xml:id="def-elem-matrices"><title>Elementary Matrices</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Matrices which are obtained by performing one elementary row operation to the identity matrix are called
          <term>elementary matrices</term>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <example><title>Continuing Gauss-Jordan with matrix multiplication</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let's return to the matrix in <xref ref="ex-rowops-matrixmult"/> and continue our row reducing process. 
          We already defined <m>E_1</m> and calculated 
          <me>
            E_1A = \left[\begin{array}{rrr} 1 \amp 2 \\ 0 \amp -1 \end{array}\right]
          </me> 
          The next step in Gauss-Jordan elimination is <m>-R_2\rightarrow R_2</m>.
          Doing this operation to the <m>2 \times 2</m> identity matrix yields 
          <md>
            <mrow>\amp \amp \amp \begin{bmatrix} 1 \amp 0 \\ 0 \amp 1 \end{bmatrix}</mrow>
            <mrow>-R_2 \amp\rightarrow R_2 \amp \amp \begin{bmatrix} 1 \amp 0 \\ 0 \amp -1 \end{bmatrix}</mrow>
          </md>.
          If we let <m>E_2=\begin{bmatrix}1 \amp 0 \\ 0 \amp -1 \end{bmatrix}</m>, 
          and multiply <m>E_2</m> by the matrix we already had after multiplying by <m>E_1</m>, we get
          <md>
            <mrow> E_2 (E_1A) \amp = \begin{bmatrix}1 \amp 0 \\ 0 \amp -1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \amp 2 \\ 0 \amp -1 \end{bmatrix} </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \amp 2 \\ 0 \amp 1 \end{bmatrix} </mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>
        <p>
          There's one more row operation we need to do to finish row reducing <m>A</m>.  
          Let's create <m>E_3</m> by performing <m>-2R_2+R_1 \rightarrow R_1</m> on the <m>2\times 2</m>
          identity matrix
          <md>
            <mrow>\amp \amp \amp \begin{bmatrix} 1 \amp 0 \\ 0 \amp 1 \end{bmatrix}</mrow>
            <mrow>-2R_2+R_1 \amp\rightarrow R_1 \amp \amp \begin{bmatrix} 1 \amp -2 \\ 0 \amp 1 \end{bmatrix}</mrow>
          </md>,
          and multiplying <m>E_3</m> by the matrix we had gives us
          <md>
            <mrow> E_3 (E_2E_1A) \amp = \begin{bmatrix}1 \amp -2 \\ 0 \amp 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \amp 2 \\ 0 \amp 1 \end{bmatrix} </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \amp 0 \\ 0 \amp 1 \end{bmatrix} </mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      To recap what we just did: we row reduced the matrix <m>A</m> by multiplying on the left by 
      three matrices in turn.  In this case, the reduced row echelon form was the identity matrix, so
      we also found matrices whose product is the identity.  Associativity means that 
      <me>
        (E_3E_2E_1)A=I
      </me>,
      which means that <m>A</m> is invertible and <m>A^{-1}=E_3E_2E_1</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is kind of a big deal.  We said in <xref ref="calculating_larger_inverses" text="title"/> that
      in order to calculate inverses we augment by the identity matrix and then row reduce.  If a matrix
      row reduces to <m>I</m> on the left then the inverse appears on the right.  Now we see another connection 
      between inverses and row reducing: if a matrix row reduces to the identity, the inverse is the product of 
      the elementary matrices which perform the row reduction.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is possible to show that since the product <m>E_3E_2E_1</m> is invertible (and it is since its inverse is <m>A</m>) 
      it is the case that <m>E_3</m>, <m>E_2</m>, and <m>E_1</m> are all invertible, too.  Instead, let's try to see
      why that has to be the case based on properties of elementary matrices.

    <exercise label="ex-elem-inverses"><title>Inverses of elementary matrices</title>
      <introduction>
        <p>
          There are 3 kinds of elementary row operations and so there are 3 kinds of elementary matrices: 
          ones which result from 1) scaling a row, 2) from interchanging two rows,
          and 3) from adding a multiple of a row to another row.

    <p>
      Let's return to our running example of this section.  We started with
      <me>
        A=\begin{bmatrix} 1 \amp 2 \\ 3 \amp 5 \end{bmatrix}
      </me>
      and through row reducing by multiplying by elementary matrices we found that
      <me>
        E_3E_2E_1A=I
      </me>.
      We've seen that elementary row operations can be undone by another elementary row operation, which means
      that every elementary matrix is invertible, and the inverse is another elementary matrix.  Thus we can multiply
      both sides of the above equation by <m>E_3^{-1}</m> and get that
      <md>
        <mrow> E_3^{-1}(E_3E_2E_1A)\amp = E_3^{-1}I </mrow>
        <mrow> (E_3^{-1}E_3)E_2E_1A\amp = E_3^{-1} </mrow>
        <mrow> E_2E_1A\amp = E_3^{-1} </mrow>
      </md>.
      Next we undo <m>E_2</m> by multiplying both sides by <m>E_2^{-1}</m> to get
      <md>
        <mrow> E_2^{-1}(E_2E_1A)\amp = E_2^{-1}E_3^{-1} </mrow>
        <mrow> E_1A\amp = E_2^{-1}E_3^{-1} </mrow>
      </md>.
      Finally, we undo <m>E_1</m> in the same way and get
      <md>
        <mrow> E_1^{-1}E_1A\amp = E_1^{-1}E_2^{-1}E_3^{-1} </mrow>
        <mrow> A\amp = E_1^{-1}E_2^{-1}E_3^{-1} </mrow>
      </md>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the inverse of an elementary matrix is also an elementary matrix, we just wrote 
      <m>A</m> as a product of elementary matrices.  Moreover, there wasn't anything special about this example;
      the fact that the reduced row echelon form of <m>A</m> is <m>I</m> meant that we could multiply <m>A</m>
      by elementary matrices to get <m>I</m>, which meant that <m>A</m> is invertible and also that <m>A</m> 
      can be expressed as the product of elementary matrices.  
    </p>
    <p>
      We have now seen a lot of different things that are equivalent to a matrix having an inverse (and there will be still more
      in the future). Let's collect what we know so far.

        Let <m>A</m> be an <m>n\times n</m> matrix.  The following are equivalent:
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>A</m> is invertible.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The reduced row echelon form of <m>A</m> is <m>I</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              There is exactly one solution (not 0 and not infinitely many) to any linear system that has <m>A</m> as its coefficient matrix.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              For any column matrix <m>X</m> with <m>n</m> rows, if <m>AX=\mathbf{0}</m>, then <m>X=\mathbf{0}</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>A</m> is the product of elementary matrices.

    </theorem>
    <p>
      A <em>theorem</em> in math is a statement which has a proof that it's true.  We don't get into full proofs, 
      but we can still explore and understand some of the reasons for each of the above equivalences.  We did a little of that just
      above the theorem, when we were seeing how row reducing to the identity led to invertibility and being able to be written
      as a product of elementary matrices, and we'll explore more during the Participate activities.

        <statement>
          <p>
            If you have found elementary matrices <m>E_1</m> and <m>E_2</m> which perform row operations, and you want to perform
            <m>E_1</m> first on a matrix <m>M</m> and then to the result perform <m>E_2</m>, which product do you calculate?

              <p>
                Just like with functions <m>f(g(x))</m>, the <m>g(x)</m> comes second as we read left-to-right, 
                but that means perform <m>g(x)</m> first and plug the result into <m>f(x)</m>. 
              </p>
              <p>
                So too with matrix multiplication.  By associativity, <m>E_1E_2M</m> is the same as <m>E_1(E_2M)</m>, which means multiply
                <m>E_2M</m> and then multiply <m>E_1</m> by the result.

            Every elementary matrix is invertible, and the inverse of an elementary matrix is also an elementary matrix.

            The inverse of scaling is scaling by the reciprocal; the inverse of swapping two rows is swapping the same two rows again;
            the inverse of multiplying a row by <m>c</m> and adding to another row is multiplying the row by <m>-c</m> and adding.

              <em>Elementary matrices</em> are the result of performing one elementary row
              operation on the identity matrix.  Multiplying a matrix on the left by an elementary
              matrix has the same result as performing that row operation on the matrix.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            We have a list of conditions that are all equivalent to a square matrix being invertible, including
            row reducing to the identity matrix and having exactly one solution to a linear system (not 0, not infinitely many solutions).

            This material is setting us up to learn more about how computers are programmed to calculate with matrices, 
            to be efficient and fast when there are hundreds, or even thousands, of numbers to add and multiply.
