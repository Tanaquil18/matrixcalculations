      Material in this section comes heavily from Greg Hartman's Fundamentals of Matrix Algebra.

    <title>Before Class</title>
  <p>
    Let's return to <xref ref="ex_by_hand">Example</xref>. As we mentioned before, there isn't just one
    <q>right</q> way of finding the solution to this system of equations.
    Here is another way to do it.
  </p>
  <p>
    First, we rewrite the equations so that all variables are on the left of the equal sign and all constants are on the right.
    Also, for a bit more consistency,
    let's list the variables in alphabetical order in each equation.
    Therefore we can write the equations as
    <men xml:id="eq_before_matrix">
      \begin{array}{ccccccc} b\amp +\amp g\amp +\amp r\amp =\amp 30\\ \amp -\amp 2g\amp +\amp r\amp =\amp 0\\ -b\amp +\amp g\amp +\amp r\amp =\amp 0 \end{array}
    </men>
  </p>
  <p>
    Now, let's add the first and last equations together,
    and write the result as a new third equation.
    This gives us:
    <me>
      \begin{array}{ccccccc} b\amp +\amp g\amp +\amp r\amp =\amp 30\\ \amp -\amp 2g\amp +\amp r\amp =\amp 0\\ \amp  \amp 2g\amp +\amp 2r\amp =\amp 30 \end{array}
    </me>.
    A nice feature of this is that the only equation with a <m>b</m> in it is the first equation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Next let's multiply the second equation by <m>-\frac{1}{2}</m>.
    This gives
    <me>
      \begin{array}{ccccccc} b\amp +\amp g\amp +\amp r\amp =\amp 30\\ \amp  \amp  g\amp -\amp \frac{1}{2}r\amp =\amp 0\\ \amp  \amp 2g\amp +\amp 2r\amp =\amp 30 \end{array}
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    Let's now do two steps in a row; our goal is to get rid of the <m>g</m> coefficients in the first and third equations.
    In order to remove the <m>g</m> in the first equation, let's multiply the second equation by <m>-1</m> and add that to the first equation,
    replacing the first equation with that sum. To remove the <m>g</m> in the third equation,
    let's multiply the second equation by <m>-2</m> and add that to the third equation, replacing the third equation. Our new system of equations now becomes
    <me>
      \begin{array}{ccccccc} b\amp +\amp  \amp  \amp \frac{3}{2}r\amp =\amp 30\\ \amp  \amp g\amp -\amp \frac{1}{2}r\amp =\amp 0\\ \amp  \amp  \amp  \amp 3r\amp =\amp 30 \end{array}
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    Clearly we can multiply the third equation by <m>\frac{1}{3}</m> and find that <m>r=10</m>;
    let's make this our new third equation, giving
    <me>
      \begin{array}{ccccccc} b\amp +\amp  \amp  \amp \frac{3}{2}r\amp =\amp 30\\ \amp  \amp g\amp -\amp \frac{1}{2}r\amp =\amp 0\\ \amp  \amp  \amp  \amp r\amp =\amp 10 \end{array}
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    Now let's get rid of the <m>r</m>'s in the first and second equation.
    To remove the <m>r</m> in the first equation,
    let's multiply the third equation by
    <m>-\frac{3}{2}</m> and add the result to the first equation,
    replacing the first equation with that sum.
    To remove the <m>r</m> in the second equation,
    we can multiply the third equation by <m>\frac{1}{2}</m> and add that to the second equation,
    replacing the second equation with that sum.
    This gives us:
    <me>
      \begin{array}{ccccccc} b\amp  \amp  \amp  \amp  \amp =\amp 15\\ \amp  \amp g\amp  \amp  \amp =\amp 5\\ \amp  \amp  \amp  \amp r\amp =\amp 10 \end{array}
    </me>.
    Clearly we have discovered the same result as when we solved this problem in <xref ref="ex_by_hand">Example</xref>, 
    even though our steps were different.
  </p>
  <p>
    As we said before, all that really matters for the solution to a problem like this are the coefficients and the constants.
    There is nothing special about the letters <m>b</m>, <m>g</m> and <m>r</m>;
    we could have used <m>x</m>, <m>y</m> and <m>z</m>, or <m>x_1</m>, <m>x_2</m> and <m>x_3</m>.
    This second method suggests that we don't actually need to write the variable names at all, as long as we carefully line them up in the system of equations.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let's look again at our system of equations in <xref ref="eq_before_matrix"/> and write the coefficients and the constants in a rectangular array. This time we won't ignore the zeros, but rather write them out.
    <me>
      \begin{array}{ccccccc} b\amp +\amp g\amp +\amp r\amp =\amp 30\\ \amp -\amp 2g\amp +\amp r\amp =\amp 0\\ -b\amp +\amp g\amp +\amp r\amp =\amp 0 \end{array} \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad \left[\begin{array}{cccc} 1\amp 1\amp 1\amp 30\\ 0\amp -2\amp 1\amp 0\\ -1\amp 1\amp 1\amp 0 \end{array} \right]
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    Notice how even the equal signs are gone; we don't need them, for we know that the last entry
     in each row is the constant of the corresponding equation.
  </p>
  <p>
    We call this array we have just created a <em>matrix</em>.
  </p>
  <definition xml:id="def_matrix">
    <title>Matrix</title>
      <idx><h>matrix</h><h>augmented matrix</h></idx>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A <term>matrix</term> is a rectangular array of numbers.
      </p>
      <p>
        The horizontal lines of numbers form <term>rows</term>
        and the vertical lines of numbers form <term>columns</term>.
        A matrix with <m>m</m> rows and <m>n</m> columns is said to be an <term><m>m\times n</m> matrix</term> (said out loud as
        <q>an <m>m</m> by <m>n</m> matrix</q>).
      </p>
      <p>
        If a matrix corresponds to a linear system of equations such that the last column corresponds to the constants
        of the system, we call the matrix an <term>augmented matrix</term>.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is often useful to be able to refer to specific entries of a matrix.  We tend to use capital letters
        for matrices, such as <m>A</m>, <m>B</m>, and <m>C</m>, and then we use lower case letters with subscripts 
        for the entries within a matrix.  That is, <m>a_{32}</m> means
        <q>the number in the third row and second column.</q>
      </p>
      <p>
        All the entries of an <m>m\times n</m> matrix <m>A</m> would appear like this:
        <me>
          A=\left[\begin{array}{ccccc} a_{11}\amp a_{12}\amp a_{13}\amp \cdots\amp a_{1n}\\ a_{21}\amp a_{22}\amp a_{23}\amp \cdots\amp a_{2n}\\ a_{31}\amp a_{32}\amp a_{33}\amp \cdots\amp a_{3n}\\ \vdots\amp \vdots\amp \vdots\amp \ddots\amp \vdots\\ a_{m1}\amp a_{m2}\amp a_{m3}\amp \cdots\amp a_{mn} \end{array} \right]
