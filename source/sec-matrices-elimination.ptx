      Mathematicians often see solutions to given problems and ask <q>What if <m>\ldots</m>?</q> 
      What are the right kinds of <q>what if</q> questions to ask?
      It's impossible to know at first <mdash/> mathematicians often ask <q>wrong</q> questions.
      That is, they often ask questions and find that the answer isn't particularly interesting.
      But asking enough questions often leads to some good <q>right</q> questions.
      Don't be afraid of doing something wrong; mathematicians do it all the time!
    </p>
    <p>
      Recall that in the previous section, we worked through a few examples of solving linear equations.
      What is a good question to ask after seeing <xref ref="ex_by_hand">Example</xref>?
      Here are two possibilities (though not the only two):
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Did we really have to call the red balls <q><m>r</m></q>? Could we call them <q><m>q</m></q>?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            What if we had <m>60</m> balls at the start instead of <m>30</m>?
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's look at the first question.
      Would the solution to our problem change if we called the red balls <m>q</m>? Of course not <mdash/>
      we picked the letter <q>r</q> because it made us think of <q>red</q>, and we could have picked any letter we liked.
      The process of solving would have been exactly the same if we used <q>q</q> instead, and at the end we'd find that <m>q = 10</m>, 
      and we would know that this meant that we had <m>10</m> red balls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now let's look at the second question. Suppose we had <m>60</m> balls, but the other 
      relationships stayed the same. How would the situation and solution change? Let's compare the 
      original equations to the new equations.
    </p>
    <tabular halign="center">
      <row>
        <cell right="minor" bottom="minor">Original</cell>
        <cell bottom="minor">New</cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell right="minor"><m>r+b+g=30</m></cell>
        <cell><m>r+b+g=60</m></cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell right="minor"><m>r=2g</m></cell>
        <cell><m>r=2g</m></cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell right="minor"><m>b=r+g</m></cell>
        <cell><m>b=r+g</m></cell>
      </row>
    </tabular>
    <p>
      By examining these equations, we see that nothing has changed except the first equation.
      It isn't too much of a stretch of the imagination to see that we would solve this new problem 
      exactly the same way that we solved the original one, except that we'd have twice as many of 
      each type of ball so that the total was <m>60</m> instead of <m>30</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two conclusions from answering these two questions are:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            it doesn't matter what we call our variables, and
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            while changing constants in the equations changes the solution,
      they don't really change the <em>method</em>
      of how we solve these equations.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, it is a great discovery to realize that all we care about are the <em>constants</em>
      and the <em>coefficients</em> of the equations.
      By systematically handling these,
      we can solve any set of linear equations in a very nice way.
    </p>
  <p>
    Let's return to <xref ref="ex_by_hand">Example</xref>. As we mentioned before, there isn't just one
    <q>right</q> way of finding the solution to this system of equations.
    Here is another way to do it.
  </p>
  <p>
    First, we rewrite the equations so that all variables are on the left of the equal sign and all constants are on the right.
    Also, for a bit more consistency,
    let's list the variables in alphabetical order in each equation.
    Therefore we can write the equations as
    <men xml:id="eq_before_matrix">
      \begin{array}{ccccccc} b\amp +\amp g\amp +\amp r\amp =\amp 30\\ \amp -\amp 2g\amp +\amp r\amp =\amp 0\\ -b\amp +\amp g\amp +\amp r\amp =\amp 0 \end{array}
    </men>
  </p>
  <p>
    Now, let's add the first and last equations together,
    and write the result as a new third equation.
    This gives us:
    <me>
      \begin{array}{ccccccc} b\amp +\amp g\amp +\amp r\amp =\amp 30\\ \amp -\amp 2g\amp +\amp r\amp =\amp 0\\ \amp  \amp 2g\amp +\amp 2r\amp =\amp 30 \end{array}
    </me>.
    A nice feature of this is that the only equation with a <m>b</m> in it is the first equation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Next let's multiply the second equation by <m>-\frac{1}{2}</m>.
    This gives
    <me>
      \begin{array}{ccccccc} b\amp +\amp g\amp +\amp r\amp =\amp 30\\ \amp  \amp  g\amp -\amp \frac{1}{2}r\amp =\amp 0\\ \amp  \amp 2g\amp +\amp 2r\amp =\amp 30 \end{array}
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    Let's now do two steps in a row; our goal is to get rid of the <m>g</m> coefficients in the first and third equations.
    In order to remove the <m>g</m> in the first equation, let's multiply the second equation by <m>-1</m> and add that to the first equation,
    replacing the first equation with that sum. To remove the <m>g</m> in the third equation,
    let's multiply the second equation by <m>-2</m> and add that to the third equation, replacing the third equation. Our new system of equations now becomes
    <me>
      \begin{array}{ccccccc} b\amp +\amp  \amp  \amp \frac{3}{2}r\amp =\amp 30\\ \amp  \amp g\amp -\amp \frac{1}{2}r\amp =\amp 0\\ \amp  \amp  \amp  \amp 3r\amp =\amp 30 \end{array}
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    Clearly we can multiply the third equation by <m>\frac{1}{3}</m> and find that <m>r=10</m>;
    let's make this our new third equation, giving
    <me>
      \begin{array}{ccccccc} b\amp +\amp  \amp  \amp \frac{3}{2}r\amp =\amp 30\\ \amp  \amp g\amp -\amp \frac{1}{2}r\amp =\amp 0\\ \amp  \amp  \amp  \amp r\amp =\amp 10 \end{array}
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    Now let's get rid of the <m>r</m>'s in the first and second equation.
    To remove the <m>r</m> in the first equation,
    let's multiply the third equation by
    <m>-\frac{3}{2}</m> and add the result to the first equation,
    replacing the first equation with that sum.
    To remove the <m>r</m> in the second equation,
    we can multiply the third equation by <m>\frac{1}{2}</m> and add that to the second equation,
    replacing the second equation with that sum.
    This gives us:
    <me>
      \begin{array}{ccccccc} b\amp  \amp  \amp  \amp  \amp =\amp 15\\ \amp  \amp g\amp  \amp  \amp =\amp 5\\ \amp  \amp  \amp  \amp r\amp =\amp 10 \end{array}
    </me>.
    Clearly we have discovered the same result as when we solved this problem in <xref ref="ex_by_hand">Example</xref>, 
    even though our steps were different.
  </p>
  <p>
    As we said before, all that really matters for the solution to a problem like this are the coefficients and the constants.
    There is nothing special about the letters <m>b</m>, <m>g</m> and <m>r</m>;
    we could have used <m>x</m>, <m>y</m> and <m>z</m>, or <m>x_1</m>, <m>x_2</m> and <m>x_3</m>.
    This second method suggests that we don't actually need to write the variable names at all, as long as we carefully line them up in the system of equations.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let's look again at our system of equations in <xref ref="eq_before_matrix"/> and write the coefficients and the constants in a rectangular array. This time we won't ignore the zeros, but rather write them out.
    <me>
      \begin{array}{ccccccc} b\amp +\amp g\amp +\amp r\amp =\amp 30\\ \amp -\amp 2g\amp +\amp r\amp =\amp 0\\ -b\amp +\amp g\amp +\amp r\amp =\amp 0 \end{array} \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad \left[\begin{array}{cccc} 1\amp 1\amp 1\amp 30\\ 0\amp -2\amp 1\amp 0\\ -1\amp 1\amp 1\amp 0 \end{array} \right]
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    Notice how even the equal signs are gone; we don't need them, for we know that the last entry
     in each row is the constant of the corresponding equation.
  </p>
  <p>
    We call this array we have just created a <em>matrix</em>.
  </p>
  <definition xml:id="def_matrix">
    <title>Matrix</title>
      <idx><h>matrix</h><h>augmented matrix</h></idx>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A <term>matrix</term> is a rectangular array of numbers.
      </p>
      <p>
        The horizontal lines of numbers form <term>rows</term>
        and the vertical lines of numbers form <term>columns</term>.
        A matrix with <m>m</m> rows and <m>n</m> columns is said to be an <term><m>m\times n</m> matrix</term> (said out loud as
        <q>an <m>m</m> by <m>n</m> matrix</q>).
      </p>
      <p>
        If a matrix corresponds to a linear system of equations such that the last column corresponds to the constants
        of the system, we call the matrix an <term>augmented matrix</term>.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is often useful to be able to refer to specific entries of a matrix.  We tend to use capital letters
        for matrices, such as <m>A</m>, <m>B</m>, and <m>C</m>, and then we use lower case letters with subscripts 
        for the entries within a matrix.  That is, <m>a_{32}</m> means
        <q>the number in the third row and second column.</q>
      </p>
      <p>
        All the entries of an <m>m\times n</m> matrix <m>A</m> would appear like this:
        <me>
          A=\left[\begin{array}{ccccc} a_{11}\amp a_{12}\amp a_{13}\amp \cdots\amp a_{1n}\\ a_{21}\amp a_{22}\amp a_{23}\amp \cdots\amp a_{2n}\\ a_{31}\amp a_{32}\amp a_{33}\amp \cdots\amp a_{3n}\\ \vdots\amp \vdots\amp \vdots\amp \ddots\amp \vdots\\ a_{m1}\amp a_{m2}\amp a_{m3}\amp \cdots\amp a_{mn} \end{array} \right]
