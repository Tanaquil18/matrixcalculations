            Enter a response to both of the following tasks:
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Ask a question about the material, either about something you're not sure you fully understand, 
                  or a <q>what if</q> question.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Give a percentage from 0 to 100 that reflects how confident you are with the material you 
                  just read about, and give one sentence as to why you feel that way.  0 means you didn't 
                  actually do the reading and 100 means that everything makes sense so far and you think you are 
                  completely ready to engage with the material more deeply.  
                </p>
              </li>
            </ol>
