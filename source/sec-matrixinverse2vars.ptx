  <title>Matrix Inverses and Two Variable Systems</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
        We have been learning how to perform arithmetic with matrices, including matrix multiplication.
        Now we learn how matrix multiplication connects to linear systems, and we learn how to
        solve two variable linear systems using the inverse of a matrix.  
    </p>
  </introduction>

  <subsection xml:id="subsec-matrixinverse2vars-bc">
    <title>Prepare</title>
    <p>
        Once again we visit the old algebra equation, <m>ax=b</m>.
        How do we solve for <m>x</m>?
        We know that, as long as <m>a\neq 0</m>,
        <me>
        x = \frac{b}{a}, \ \text{ or, stated in another way, }  \ x = a^{-1}b
        </me>
    </p>
    <p>
        What is <m>a^{-1}</m>?
        It is the number that, when multiplied by <m>a</m>, returns 1.
        That is,
        <me>
        a^{-1}a = 1
        </me>
    </p>
    <p>
        Let us now think in terms of matrices.
        We have learned of the identity matrix <m>I</m> that
        <q>acts like the number 1.</q>
        That is, if <m>A</m> is a square matrix, then
        <me>
        I A =  A I =  A
        </me>.
        If we had a matrix,
        which we'll call <m>A^{-1}</m>, where <m>A^{-1} A= I</m>,
        then by analogy to our algebra example above it seems like we might be able to solve the linear system
        <m>A \vec{x} = \vec{b}</m> for <m>\vec{x}</m> by multiplying both sides of the equation by <m>A^{-1}</m>.
        That is, perhaps
        <me>
        \vec{x} =  A^{-1}\vec{b}
        </me>
    </p>
    <p>
        Of course, there is a lot of speculation here.
        We don't know that such a matrix like <m>A^{-1}</m> exists.
        However, we do know how to solve the matrix equation <m>A X = B</m>,
        so we can use that technique to solve the equation <m>A X = I</m> for <m>X</m>. This seems like it will get us close to what we want.
        Let's practice this once and then study our results.
    </p>
    <p>
    So given a square matrix <m>A</m>,
    if we can find a matrix <m>X</m> where <m>A X= I</m>,
    then we know that <m>X A = I</m> and that <m>X</m> is the only matrix that does this.
    This makes <m>X</m> special, so we give it a special name.

        Let <m>A</m> and <m>X</m> be
        <m>n\times n</m> matrices where <m>A X = I = X A</m>.
        Then:

  <theorem xml:id="thm_2by2"><title>The Inverse of a <m>2\times 2</m> Matrix</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let
        <me>
          A = \left[\begin{array}{cc} a\amp b\\c\amp d \end{array} \right]
        </me>.
        <m>A</m> is invertible if and only if <m>ad-bc\neq 0</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If <m>ad-bc \neq 0</m>, then
        <me>
          A^{-1} = \frac{1}{ad-bc}\left[\begin{array}{cc} d\amp -b\\-c\amp a \end{array} \right]
        </me>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <p>
    We can't divide by 0, so if <m>ad-bc=0</m>, we don't have an inverse.
    Recall <xref ref="ex_inverse_2">Example</xref>, where
    <me>
      A = \left[\begin{array}{cc} 1\amp 2\\2\amp 4 \end{array} \right]
    </me>.
    Here, <m>ad-bc = 1(4) - 2(2) = 0</m>,
    which is why <m>A</m> didn't have an inverse.
  </p>
  <p>
    Although this idea is simple, we should practice it.
  </p>
    <example xml:id="ex_inverse_4"><title>Using the formula for <m>2\times 2</m> inverses </title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Use <xref ref="thm_2by2">Theorem</xref> to find the inverse of
        <me>
          A = \left[\begin{array}{cc} 3 \amp  2\\-1 \amp  9 \end{array} \right]
        </me>
        if it exists.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        Since <m>ad-bc = 29 \neq 0</m>, <m>A^{-1}</m> exists.
        By the Theorem,
        <md>
          <mrow>A^{-1} \amp = \frac{1}{3(9)-2(-1)}\left[\begin{array}{cc} 9\amp -2</mrow>

        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        We can leave our answer in this form, or we could
        <q>simplify</q>
        it as
        <me>
          A^{-1} = \frac{1}{29}\left[\begin{array}{cc} 9\amp -2\\1\amp 3 \end{array} \right] = \left[\begin{array}{cc}  9/29 \amp  -2/29\\1/29 \amp  3/29 \end{array} \right]
        </me>
      </p>
    </solution>
  </example>
  <p>
    We started this section out by speculating that just as we solved algebraic equations of the form <m>ax=b</m> by computing <m>x = a^{-1}b</m>,
    we might be able to solve matrix equations of the form
    <m>A \vec{x} = \vec{b}</m> by computing <m>\vec{x} =  A^{-1}\vec{b}</m>.
    If <m>A^{-1}</m> does exist,
    then we <em>can</em> solve the equation <m>A \vec{x} = \vec{b}</m> this way.
    Consider:
    <md>
      <mrow>A \vec{x} \amp = \vec{b} \amp  \amp  \textsf{(original equation)}</mrow>
      <mrow>A^{-1} A\vec{x} \amp =  A^{-1}\vec{b} \amp  \amp \textsf{ (multiply both sides \textit{on the left} by  A^{-1})}</mrow>
      <mrow>I\vec{x} \amp =  A^{-1}\vec{b} \amp  \amp \textsf{ (since $ A^{-1} A= I$)}</mrow>
      <mrow>\vec{x} \amp =  A^{-1}\vec{b} \amp  \amp \textsf{ (since $ I\vec{x} = \vec{x}$)}</mrow>
    </md>
  </p>
  <p>
    Let's step back and think about this for a moment.
    The only thing we know about the equation
    <m>A \vec{x} = \vec{b}</m> is that <m>A</m> is invertible.
    We also know that solutions to
    <m>A \vec{x} = \vec{b}</m> come in three forms:
    exactly one solution, infinite solutions, and no solution.
    We just showed that if <m>A</m> is invertible,
    then <m>A \vec{x} = \vec{b}</m> has
    <em>at least</em> one solution.
      We showed that by setting <m>\vec{x}</m> equal to <m>A^{-1}\vec{b}</m>, we have a solution.
    Is it possible that more solutions exist?
  </p>
  <p>
    No.
    Suppose we are told that a known vector <m>\vec{v}</m> is a solution to the equation <m>A \vec{x} = \vec{b}</m>;
    that is, we know that <m>A\vec{v}=\vec{b}</m>.
    We can repeat the above steps:
    <md>
      <mrow>A\vec{v} \amp =\vec{b}</mrow>
      <mrow>A^{-1} A\vec{v} \amp = A^{-1}\vec{b}</mrow>
      <mrow>I\vec{v} \amp =  A^{-1}\vec{b}</mrow>
      <mrow>\vec{v} \amp =  A^{-1}\vec{b}</mrow>
    </md>.
  </p>
  <p>
    This shows that <em>all</em> solutions to <m>A \vec{x} = \vec{b}</m> are exactly
    <m>\vec{x} = A^{-1}\vec{b}</m> when <m>A</m> is invertible.
    We have just proved the following theorem.
  </p>
  <theorem xml:id="thm_inverse_solution"><title>Invertible Matrices and Solutions to <m>A \vec{x} = \vec{b}</m></title><idx><h>solution</h><h>unique</h></idx>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>A</m> be an invertible <m>n\times n</m> matrix,
          and let <m>\vec{b}</m> be any <m>n\times 1</m> column vector.
        Then the equation <m>A \vec{x} = \vec{b}</m> has exactly one solution, namely
        <me>
          \vec{x} =  A^{-1}\vec{b}
        </me>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <p>
    A corollary<fn>
    a <em>corollary</em> is an idea that follows directly from a theorem
    </fn> to this theorem is: If <m>A</m> is not invertible,
    then <m>A \vec{x} = \vec{b}</m> does not have exactly one solution.
    It may have infinite solutions or it may have no solution,
    and we would need to examine the reduced row echelon form of the augmented matrix
    <m>\left[\begin{array}{cc} A \amp \vec{b} \end{array} \right]</m> to see which case applies.
