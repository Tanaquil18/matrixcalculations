  "body": " It seems everyone finds a way to cover linear algebra differently, and my institution is no exception. We have two separate semester-long 1-credit courses that students typically take in their first year alongside calculus I and II. The courses are aimed at introducing the calculations of linear algebra without much theory or abstraction. As I understand the department historical lore, the reason for this is so that computer science and engineering students learn the topics they need without having to get the more theoretical (and proof-heavy) treatment involving abstract vector spaces that math majors will encounter in a later course.  Before this book, we were happily using a combination of existing resources. The first among these is Fundamentals of Matrix Algebra by Gregory Hartman. His work is similarly light on theory and abstraction and covers topics in a similar order, but it does too much of some things and omits other things we want to include. Still, I have made use of his Creative Commons license and borrowed much of his work as the foundation for mine, some of it not changed much or at all. The second is Understanding Linear Algebra by David Austin. I have also borrowed heavily from his work, particularly the material on LU Decomposition and Markov Chains. I am deeply indebted to both of them for writing and sharing their work so freely.  This book is written so that each section corresponds to one day of class. As an instructor, I have often thought of student learning taking place before class , during class , and after class , and so each section of this book (except the first) contains Prepare , Participate , and Practice material. The Prepare material is meant to be accessible for students to read and complete on their own without an instructor. I have written and included at least 2 interactive questions plus a set of reading questions to be completed so that students can assess their understanding and identify any gaps. I had the principle in mind that every student should be able to get or be shown the right answer eventually, with explanations provided for common mistakes. The Participate material is structured much differently, with answers and feedback not as readily visible, and it's intended to be suitable for students to work on during class in groups under the supervision of an instructor.  The Practice exercises are interactive and autograded so that students do have feedback as to correctness, but they most often do not include explanations. The Additional Practice exercises are what you might find in a typical paper textbook, with answers provided but not solutions. Most of these came directly from the books of Hartman or Austin. Exercises from either set should be suitable to assign for after class or review before an exam.  If the html version of this book is hosted on Runestone, then student work on the interactive elements can be saved and grades assigned.  I welcome feedback and corrections. As I tried to make clear above, many of the good ideas contained herein are not mine and credit is due to Gregory Hartman and David Austin. I have rearranged the structure, added interactive elements, and done some amount of editing and revising. The blame for any errors belongs entirely to me.  "

  "title": "Linear Equations and Substitution",
  "body": " Linear Equations and Substitution   Normally, there will be some Prepare material before you are asked to Participate, but this is the first section. Let's begin, not prepare to begin.  We start by examining a very common and useful type of equation and see one way of solving a collection of such equations.    Participate  Perhaps you've seen images like the ones shown below.    a collage of different math problems using pictures of food   A collage of different math problems using pictures of food   Images like the ones above have been frequently shared on social media, prompting this mathematician to reflect that algebra seems more palatable when it's disguised as puzzles involving food.    girl making a bad face at math with variables x, y, z, and an interested face at doing math with food   Disguising math as food puzzles seems more palatable   Most of the images in the collage above also contain an element of competitiveness of being able to figure out something that other people have a hard time with. Many of the puzzles in the collage say something like Only 1 in 7 can solve this! or 95% of people will fail to answer.  Many of them also contain a visual trick which causes extra confusion or controversy. For example, consider the puzzle in this image.   Solve a fruit puzzle     an algebra puzzle involving food, claiming most people can't solve it    The image above says that three apples total 18, while an apple plus two bunches of bananas total 14, and a bunch of bananas minus cherries equals 2.  Then it asks a question: how much does cherries plus an apple plus a bunch of bananas equal? The answer is         Each apple is worth 6, each bunch of 4 bananas is worth 4, so each banana is worth 1, and each group of cherries is worth 2. There are only 3 bananas in the question to answer, so 2+6+3=11.       You did the algebra correctly! However, this puzzle also contains a visual trick, designed to make people get the question wrong. Earlier on, there are 4 bananas in each bunch of bananas, so each banana is worth 1. But in the question you are asked to answer, the bunch of bananas picture has changed and contains 3 bananas, not 4.       The food puzzle above was really setting up a number of algebraic equations. Let's see how we can translate the puzzle into mathematical equations, with letters standing in for the images or words. We could choose any letters we like, but we'll use to represent apples , to mean bunch of bananas , and to stand for cherries.     Three apples add up to 18.     Apple plus 2 bunches of bananas equals 14.     Bunch of bananas minus cherries equals 2.     Solving the puzzle meant finding values for each of the foods that made all the equations true, that is, finding the values of , , and . And then also realizing that the picture of bunch of bananas changed so that we really needed to find the value of each banana.   Almost all the food puzzles are these same kinds of equations, called linear equations . Before defining what that means in general, let's explore another example from both graphical and algebraic perspectives.     Consider the equation . When and , the equation is true, so I've plotted the point . Think of at least more values of and that satisfy the equation, and plot them as points. Typing the point in a row below in the format will plot the point.   Solutions to the equation    What do you notice about the visual relationship between the points on the graph, that is, points that satisfy the equation ?    Scroll down to the lower rows of the graph interactive, activate and animate the point found there.       Now consider the equation . When and , the equation is true, so I've plotted the point . Think of at least more values of and that satisfy the equation (your answers don't have to be whole numbers!), and plot them as points by typing each one in format in a row below.   Solutions to the equation    What does the graph of look like?       The graphs of and are shown in the image below.   Graph of two lines and their point of intersection    a=1\/3  f(x) = 2-x  g(x) = (15-15*x)\/6               What does the point of intersection mean, and what are its coordinates?      Sony and The Interview   Below is an image of part of a New York Times article about a movie The Interview    Snapshot of part of an article from a major news source   The article is about the release of the movie, which generated controversy and so was released direct to streaming. Sony reported that   the movie made about 15 million dollars total, split between sales which cost $15 and rentals which cost $6, and    there were about 2 million transactions in total.     Then the author of the article claimed that Sony did not release how many of the transactions were rentals and how many were sales. Can you do better than the author of the article and figure out how many of the transactions were sales and how many were rentals?    Try using for the number of sales and for the number of rentals. What equations do you get from the information about the total number of transactions, and total dollar amount earned? Perhaps refer to .    If is the number of millions of sales and is the number of millions of rentals, then million transactions. Also, million dollars of revenue, since each sale cost $15 and each rental cost $6.  We can solve this set of two equations by substitution : solving for one of the variables in one equation and substituting the resulting expression into the other equation. The strategy is to use one equation to reduce the number of variables in the second equation, so that we obtain an equation with just one variable that we can solve in our usual ways.  Rearranging the first equation we get that , and then plugging that in for in the second equation gives .  Multiplying out gives , and combining like terms results in . Subtracting the 12 from both sides gives , and dividing both sides by 9 yields .  So one-third of a million, or roughly transactions were sales. To find the number of rentals, we can substitute this value back into either equation, but seems easier. Then , which means that , and of a million is roughly transactions.     Jar of multicolored marbles   Suppose a jar contains red, blue and green marbles. You are told that there are a total of marbles in the jar; there are twice as many red marbles as green ones; the number of blue marbles is the same as the sum of the red and green marbles. How many marbles of each color are there?    Let's let represent the number of red marbles, and let and denote the number of blue and green marbles, respectively. We can use the given statements about the marbles in the jar to create some equations.  Since we know there are marbles in the jar, we know that .  Also, we are told that there are twice as many red marbles as green ones, so we know that .  Finally, we know that the number of blue marbles is the same as the sum of the red and green marbles, so we have .  Collecting these equations together and giving them numbers to make it easier to refer to them, we have   There are many ways to use this information to find the solution. One way is to combine ideas from equations and ; in replace with . This gives us .  We can then combine equations , and by replacing in with as we did before, and replacing with to get   We can now use equation to find and ; we know from that and then since , we find that .    All of the examples we've seen so far, such as or , have involved linear equations . It turns out that linear equations are at the heart of many modern applications: data science, sports analytics, graphics, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and so on. Let's define what linear equations are.  Linear Equation   linear equation  coefficients  constant  A linear equation is an equation that can be written in the form where the are variables (the unknowns), the are coefficients (numbers), and is a constant (also a number).    Let's look at some examples of equations and see if we can tell what makes an equation linear or not.  Multiple-Choice, Linear or Nonlinear   For each of the following equations, use to decide whether the equation is linear or not.            Linear    The equation has the correct form: it is a sum of variables multiplied by numbers (that happen to be 1), which add up to equal a constant.      Not linear    The equation does have the form , because it is a sum of variables multiplied by numbers (that happen to be 1), which add up to equal a constant.               Linear    The equation does not have the correct form because the variables and are multiplied together, not multiplied by numbers and added.      Not linear    The variables can't be multiplied together in a linear equation.               Linear    It doesn't matter for being linear or not that we have to rearrange the equation to see the correct form appear.      Not linear    It doesn't matter for being linear or not that we have to rearrange the equation to see the correct form appear. This is the same as , which is a sum of variables multiplied by numbers (that happen to be 1), which add up to equal a constant.               Linear    The equation does not have the correct form; the variables in a linear equation cannot be raised to exponents other than 1.      Not linear    The variables in a linear equation cannot be raised to exponents other than 1.               Linear    The equation does not have the correct form; the variables in a linear equation can't be arguments of functions like sine or natural log.      Not linear    The variables in a linear equation can't be arguments of functions like sine or natural log.               Linear    The variables are being multiplied by numbers and added up to equal a number.      Not linear    The variables are , , and we can assume . They are being multiplied by numbers, since since , , and 0 are numbers, and are being added up to equal a number, since is a number.       In all of our examples, we didn't have just one linear equation but rather a collection of linear equations we used together. A set of linear equations has a name we will define now.  System of Linear Equations   system of linear equations definition  system of linear equations solution  solution  A system of linear equations is a set of linear equations that involves the same set of variables.  A solution to a system of linear equations is a set of values for the variables such that each equation in the system is satisfied.    For example, in Example , when we answered how many marbles of each color are there?, we were also answering find a solution to a system of linear equations, where the linear system in the problem was    Another example of a system of linear equations is   It is important to notice that not all equations used all of the variables (it is more accurate to say that the coefficients can be , so the last equation could have been written as ). Also, just because we have four unknowns does not mean we have to have four equations. We could have had fewer, even just one, and we could have had more.   At this stage, we have yet to discuss how to efficiently find a solution to a system of linear equations. That is a goal for the upcoming sections. Right now we focus on identifying linear equations and solving some smaller systems of equations using substitution.    Summary      Linear equations are equations which can be written in the form , where the are variables, the are coefficients, and is a constant.    A system of linear equations is a set of linear equations referring to the same variables. Solving a system of linear equations means finding values for the variables such that all the equations are true with those values.    Systems of linear equations are behind many important applications in physics, engineering, and computer science, and solving linear systems will be a significant part of this course. For now though, we use substitution and wait for a better way.       Practice   Find the point of intersection    Find the point of intersection of the lines and    a graph with axes depicting two intersecting lines   The point of intersection is where and .                  Two variable substitution    The solution of the linear system   is  and                  Marbles in a Jar    Suppose a jar contains red, blue and green marbles. You are told that there are a total of marbles in the jar; there are twice as many red marbles as green ones; the number of blue marbles is the same as the sum of the red and green marbles. How many marbles of each color are there?

  "title": "Matrices and Elimination",
  "body": " Matrices and Elimination   We saw that substitution is one way of solving systems of linear equations, but the method of substituion is not very practical when there are more than 2 or 3 varibables. In this section, we start learning a more generalizable and easy-to-automate way of solving systems of linear equations.    Prepare   Mathematicians often see solutions to given problems and ask What if ? What are the right kinds of what if questions to ask? It's impossible to know at first, and so mathematicians very often ask wrong questions. That is, they often ask questions and find that the answer isn't particularly interesting. However, asking enough questions often will result in some good right questions. The answers to right questions help us see a bigger picture more clearly and usually lead to something applicable beyond the initial problem. The moral of the story is: don't be afraid of doing something wrong because mathematicians do it all the time!   Recall that in the previous section, we worked through a few examples of solving linear equations using substitution; that is, we solved for one variable in one equation and substituted the resulting expression into another equation. What is a good question to ask after seeing Example ? Here are two possibilities (though not the only two):   Did we really have to call the red balls ? Could we call them ?    What if we had balls at the start instead of ?     Let's look at the first question. Would the solution to our problem change if we called the red balls ? No, we picked the letter r because it made us think of red , but we could have picked , , or any other letter instead. The process of solving would have been exactly the same if we used q for the number of red balls, and at the end we'd find that , and we would know that this meant that we had red balls.  Now let's look at the second question. Suppose we had balls, but the other relationships stayed the same. How would the situation and solution change? Let's compare the original equations to the new equations.    Original  New                The process of solving would stay exactly the same, substituting for in the third equation to get that , and then substituting for both and in the first equation to get that . The only difference is that total is instead of , so the value of is twice as much, and thus also the values of and are twice what they had been.  Two conclusions from answering these two questions are:   it doesn't matter what we call our variables, and    while changing the constants in the equations changes the solution, they don't really change the method of how we solve these equations.     In fact, it is a great discovery to realize that all that matters about a linear system are the constants and the coefficients of the equations. By systematically handling these, we can solve any set of linear equations in a way that saves on processing power, whether the processing is being done by a human or by a computer.   Clickable Areas, Coefficients   Identify (by clicking, or by circling) all of the coefficients in this linear equation.                 The coefficients are the numbers that are multiplied by the variables.     Clickable Areas, Constants   Identify (by clicking, or by circling) all of the constants in this linear equation.                   The constants are the numbers that aren't multiplied by any variables.      Method of Elimination (of Variables)  Let's return to Example . As we mentioned before, there isn't just one right way of finding the solution to this system of equations. Here is another way to do it.  First, we rewrite the equations so that all variables are on the left of the equal sign and all constants are on the right. Also, for a bit more consistency, let's list the variables in alphabetical order in each equation. Therefore we can write the equations as   Now, let's add the first and last equations together, and write the result as a new third equation. This gives us: . A nice feature of this is that the only equation with a in it is the first equation. One could say that we eliminated the from the third equation.  Next let's multiply the second equation by . This gives   Use equations to eliminate variables    Consider the equations We want to use the second equation to eliminate the variable from the first equation. What step should we take?      Multiply the second equation by and add to the first equation.    This would make the first equation , which didn't eliminate the .      Multiply the second equation by and add to the first equation.    This gives , which eliminates the .      Multiply the second equation by and add to the first equation.    This makes the first equation , which eliminates the in the first equation, not the .        Consider the equations We want to use the top equation to eliminate the variable from the bottom equation. What step should we take?      Multiply the top equation by and add to the bottom equation.    This would make the bottom equation , which didn't eliminate the .      Multiply the top equation by and subtract from the bottom equation.    This would eliminate the , but to use this method systematically, we're always going to want to multiply and add , not subtract. Subtracting is the same as adding though!      Multiply the top equation by and add to the bottom equation.    This makes the bottom equation , which eliminates the from the bottom equation.       Let's now do both of those steps in a row to eliminate the from the first and third equations; multiply the second equation by and add that to the first equation, replacing the first equation with that sum, and multiply the second equation by and add that to the third equation, replacing the third equation. Our new system of equations now becomes   We can now multiply the third equation by and find that ; let's make this our new third equation, giving   Now let's eliminate the 's in the first and second equation. To remove the in the first equation, let's multiply the third equation by and add the result to the first equation, replacing the first equation with that sum. To remove the in the second equation, we can multiply the third equation by and add that to the second equation, replacing the second equation with that sum. This gives us: . We have arrived at the same result as when we solved this problem in Example , even though our steps were different.    Why did we need to learn another method (elimination) when our old method (substitution) worked and got the same answer?  Everyone thinks of a different way to solve a system using substitution Mary might choose a different variable to solve for than John chose, and Alicia might start with a different equation, and Steven might substitute into a different equation. When there are more than 2 or 3 variables, substituting gets really laborious, and it's not always clear what steps should come next in order to make progress in solving. Elimination can be made into an algorithm, a set of steps to follow in a particular order that will always result in an answer. Even if sometimes the answer is that there is no solution, or that there are infinitely many solutions. This is both comforting and practical; if you have to work a problem by hand, it's nice to know you'll be able to complete it as long as you remember the steps, and if you don't have to work the problem by hand, an algorithm means it's possible to program a computer to do the steps for you.    Parsons Problem, Elimination vs Substitution   Solve the linear system using the method of elimination.      Multiply the first equation by and add the result to the second equation, yielding     Add to the other side of the first equation, getting , and divide both sides by , resulting in .      Substitute the expression for from the first equation into the second equation, yielding , which simplifies to .    Multiply both sides of the second equation by , yielding       Substitute the value of from the second equation into the first equation, resulting in , so , which means that .    Multiply the second equation by and add the result to the first equation, resulting in , and multiplying both sides by yields .       Matrices  We noticed earlier that there is nothing special about the letters , and ; we could have used , and , or , and . Our work demonstrating the method of elimination suggests that we don't actually need to write the variable names at all, as long as we carefully line them up in the system of equations so that we can keep track of what's being eliminated.  Let's look again at our system of equations in and write the coefficients and the constants in a rectangular array. If any variables are missing from any equations, we write that the coefficient is .   Notice how even the equal signs are gone; we don't need them, for we know that the last entry in each row is the constant of the corresponding equation.  We call this array we have just created a matrix .   Matrix  matrix augmented matrix   A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers.  The horizontal lines of numbers form rows and the vertical lines of numbers form columns . A matrix with rows and columns is said to be an matrix (said out loud as an by matrix ).  If a matrix corresponds to a linear system of equations such that the last column corresponds to the constants of the system, we call the matrix an augmented matrix .  We tend to use capital letters for matrices (the plural of matrix), such as , , and , and we use lowercase letters with subscripts for the entries within a matrix. That is, means the number in the third row and second column of matrix .  All the entries of an matrix would appear like this:     Since matrices contain all the important information from a linear system, we are working our way up to solving systems using only augmented matrices. Using matrices saves us from having to write out the variables over and over again, and matrices are also easy for a computer to understand and manipulate. Matrices are important objects in their own right, and in future sections, we will be able to compute with matrices even when we don't think of them as corresponding to a system of linear equations.      How a matrix is indexed   In the matrix what is ?        The entry in the second row and third column is 6.      The row number comes first, then the column number.      Incorrect. If you're stuck, try reviewing the definition of matrix .        Elimination vs. substitution   Consider the method of substitution used in and the method of elimination described in this section.

Create your own linear system, with however many variables and equations you choose.       Summary     The method of elimination is a way of solving systems of linear equations that can be made systematic and algorithmic.     Matrices are arrays of numbers. Right now, we are most interested in augmented matrices , whose entries correspond to the coefficients and constants of a system of linear equations.    Elimination works better than substitution when there are more than 2 or 3 variables, and it is the foundation of future sections of material.

  "title": "Row Operations",
  "body": " Row Operations   We've now seen how to solve linear systems using substitution and elimination, and how to create an augmented matrix representing a linear system. In this section, we see how to perform the variable elimination steps directly on the matrix and interpret the results to give the solution to the corresponding linear system.    Prepare  We use the method of elimination again, but directly on the augmented matrix containing only the coefficients and constants. The steps are essentially the same, except that every time we used the word equation before, we substitute the word row instead.  Solve a system with equations and matrices side by side  Let's redo the work we did last section in our marbles example , this time side by side with the augmented matrix representing the system. Our first step was to write the equations with all the variables on the left side of the equal sign and in alphabetical order, as we did in Equation .  The words explain how we get from the current set of equations (or matrix) to the one on the next line.            Replace equation 3 with the sum of equations 1 and 3.  Replace row 3 with the sum of rows 1 and 3.             Multiply equation 2 by .  Multiply row 2 by .             Replace equation 1 with the sum of times equation 2 plus equation 1. Replace equation 3 with the sum of times equation 2 plus equation 3.  Replace row 1 with the sum of times row 2 plus row 1. Replace row 3 with the sum of times row 2 plus row 3.             Multiply equation 3 by .  Multiply row 3 by .             Replace equation 2 with the sum of times equation 3 plus equation 2. Replace equation 1 with the sum of times equation 3 plus equation 1.  Replace row 2 with the sum of times row 3 plus row 2. Replace row 1 with the sum of times row 3 plus row 1.             The final matrix contains the same solution information as we have on the left. Recall that the first column of our matrices held the coefficients of the variable; the second column held the coefficients of the variable, and the third column held the coefficients of the variable. Therefore, the first row of the matrix can be interpreted as or more concisely,    This is powerful stuff! We write an augmented matrix so that we don't have to keep writing variables over and over again, and now we can solve a linear system by performing operations on the rows of the matrix, without thinking about the linear equations at all, until we can read off the solution to the linear system at the end of the process.    Row operations   In the following tasks, perform the row operations described on the given matrix.     Consider the matrix . Which matrix is the result of multiplying Row 1 by and adding to Row 3?           This multiplied Row 1 by and replaced Row 1. It didn't do anything to Row 3.           Correct!           In the multiply and add row operation, you don't change the row you multiplied by a number; you only change the row you added to.           We have to do the operation to the entire row, not just the first entry.        Consider the matrix . Which matrix is the result of multiplying Row 1 by ?           Correct!           This multiplied both Row 1 and Row 3 by .           This multiplied Row 2 by .        Consider the matrix . Which matrix is the result of interchanging Row 2 and Row 3?           Correct!           This interchanged Row 1 and Row 2.           This replaced Row 2 with a copy of Row 3, but didn't replace Row 3 with a copy of Row 2.       We can save ourselves even more writing by using a shorthand to describe the operations we do to the matrix rows. We use , to represent Row 1 and Row 2, respectively. We can write add Row 1 to Row 3, and replace Row 3 with that sum as . We also replaced Row 2 with of Row 2; we write this in shorthand as .  There is one more operation we can do to rows of a matrix without changing the corresponding system of linear equations; the solutions don't change if we write the equations down in a different order. Thus we can swap the positions of two rows, and the expression means interchange Row 1 and Row 2.    Elementary Row Operations  Let , be two arbitrary rows of a matrix, say Row and Row , and let be a nonzero number. The three elementary row operations are:   Add the result of multiplying a row by a nonzero number to another row, and replace the latter row with that sum, denoted .    Multiply one row by a nonzero number, denoted .    Swap the positions of two rows, denoted .        Row operations notation   In the following tasks, say which elementary row operation was performed on matrix to obtain matrix .     Consider the matrices        Which row operation was done to to obtain ?           Multiply Row 1 by and add to Row 2, replacing Row 2.           This says to multiply Row 1 by , add to Row 2, and replace Row 1 . Row 1 was not changed. This is also not one of the three elementary row operations: we replace the row we added to, not the row we multiplied by a number.           This would make the second row . This is also not one of the elementary row operations - we multiply and add, never multiply and subtract.        Consider the matrices        Which row operation was done to to obtain ?           Correct!           This says Row 1 and Row 2 were swapped.           This says Row 1 replaces Row 3, but we need the arrow to go both ways to say that Row 3 also replaces Row 1. This is also not one of the three elementary row operations.        Consider the matrices        Which row operation was done to to obtain ?           Correct!           This says Row 3 was multiplied by . Check again.           This says Row 3 was multiplied by and the result replaced Row 2 . This is not one of the three elementary row operations.       Let's see one more example of solving a linear system with the equations and the augmented matrices side by side.   Equations and Matrices Side by Side   Find a solution to the following system of linear equations by simultaneously manipulating the equations and the corresponding augmented matrices.     We turn the given system into its corresponding augmented matrix.    System of equations  Corresponding matrix        First, we use the first equation to eliminate the from the second and third equations.    Replace equation 2 with the sum of times equation 1 plus equation 2. Replace equation 3 with the sum of equation 1 and equation 3.           Notice that the second equation no longer contains . We'll exchange the order of the equations so that we can follow the convention of solving for the second variable in the second equation.    Interchange equations 2 and 3.         Multiply equation 2 by .         Multiply equation 3 by .         Notice that the last row tells us that . If we wanted to combine the methods of substitution and elimination, we could substitute in for the in the first two equations, and that would make a lot of sense! However, we choose to demonstrate how continuing with the method of elimination arrives at the same result.    Replace equation 2 with the sum of times equation 3 plus equation 2. Replace equation 1 with the sum of times equation 3 plus equation 1.           Notice how the second equation shows that . All that remains to do is to solve for .    Replace equation 1 with the sum of times equation 2 plus equation 1.         The equations on the left tell us that , and , and the matrix on the right tells us the same information.       Row operation, yes or no?   Let be a matrix. Which of the following notations represent elementary row operations we can perform on ?           We can't multiply a row by , only by a nonzero number. If we multiply both sides of an equation by 0, we get 0=0, which is true but rarely helpful.           Replace Row 4 with the result of multiplying Row 2 by the number 5 and adding that to Row 4.           Two times Row 1 replaces Row 1.           In the row operation involving multiplying and adding, we don't replace the same row that we multiplied by a number.           Swap Row 3 and Row 4.           We can't just replace Row 4 with Row 3 without losing information about the linear system.       Parsons Problem, Sequence of Row Operations   Start with matrix and perform these row operations one after another. Give the matrix that results from doing each operation in order.                                      Reflection     How confident do you feel with the material you just read about?      Not at all confident or didn't do the reading.      Not very confident.      Somewhat confident.      Mostly confident.      Confident so far and ready to engage more deeply.

Participate     Solve linear systems using row operations on augmented matrices    Recognize and use the elementary row operations and their notations        Row Operations Notation   For the matrix , give the matrix that results from performing each of the row operations below.      .            .            .          Side-by-side Elimination and Matrices   Solve the linear system below using the method of elimination side-by-side with row operations.                   What row operation was done?   Write down the row operation that transforms into the matrix given in each exercise.                                          Two truths and a lie?   Using shorthand row operation notation, write down two elementary row operations and one thing that looks like but isn't an elementary row operation.    Exploring non-elementary row operations     Do something to the matrix in Problem that is not an elementary row operation, and write down the matrix that you get.      Solve the linear system corresponding to your new matrix. Does the linear system corresponding to your new matrix have the same solution as the linear system in Problem ?      If the linear system has the same solution, can you write down a sequence of elementary row operations that results in your new matrix?        Summary     Row operations are actions we do to the rows of a matrix that correspond to the elimination steps that we perform on the equations in a linear system.    Solving a linear system by performing row operations on an augmented matrix involves the same steps as elimination but with less writing.    There are three elementary row operations and shorthand notations for each of the three.       Practice  Some row operations    Given the matrix   perform the row operation on and enter the result.  Perform the row operation on and enter the result.        A sequence of row operations    Given the matrix   perform the row operations below in the order given and enter the final result.

  "body": " Reduced Row Echelon Form   We have learned about the method of elimination of variables and about row operations on matrices; in this section, we learn Gauss-Jordan elimination to put matrices into reduced row echelon form .    Prepare  Performing elementary row operations on an augmented matrix resulted in a new linear system whose solution was the same as the original linear system. This brings to mind two good questions:   What is the goal of using elementary row operations?    How do we achieve that goal the fastest?     We'll answer the first question first. In , when we manipulated matrices to find solutions, we were in fact putting the matrix into reduced row echelon form .   Reduced Row Echelon Form  reduced row echelon form  row echelon form   A matrix is in reduced row echelon form if its entries satisfy all four of the following conditions.   The first nonzero entry in each row is a (called a leading ). leading one     Each leading comes in a column to the right of the leading 's in rows above it.    All rows of all 's come at the bottom of the matrix.    If a column contains a leading , then all other entries in that column are .     A matrix that satisfies the first three conditions is said to be in row echelon form .     RREF or not?

Reduced row echelon form    Correct!      Not in reduced row echelon form    The rref conditions don't say that leading 1's have to exist; the conditions say that if nonzero entries are present, then leading 1's have to be in certain relative positions.               Reduced row echelon form    Correct!      Not in reduced row echelon form    The second column does not have a leading 1 in it, but that's okay; the conditions for rref don't say that every column has to contain a leading 1.

Reduced row echelon form    The first nonzero entry of the second row is , and it needs to be to be in rref. (The third row fails this condition also).

Reduced row echelon form    The second column has a leading in it (from the second row), and that means all the other entries in that column have to be .      Not in reduced row echelon form    Correct!       We began this section with two questions, Where do we go? and How do we get there quickly? We've just answered the first question: most of the time we are going to reduced row echelon form. We now address the second question.  There are many ways to use elementary row operations to transform a matrix into reduced row echelon form, but there is a general technique that is efficient and doesn't waste time on unnecessary steps. This technique is called Gauss-Jordan elimination , named in honor of the mathematicians Karl Friedrich Gauss and Wilhelm Jordan.   Gauss-Jordan Elimination  Gauss-Jordan elimination   Gauss-Jordan elimination is the technique for finding the reduced row echelon form of a matrix using the procedure summarized below:   Create a leading .    Use this leading to put zeros underneath it.    Repeat the above steps until all possible rows have leading 's.    Put zeros above these leading 's.      This is roughly what we were already doing in previous sections when we used elimination and row operations, but let's see an example.   Gauss-Jordan Elimination Demonstrated  Put the augmented matrix of the following system of linear equations into reduced row echelon form.   We start by converting the linear system into an augmented matrix.   Our first step is to make the first entry in the first row a . We do this by multiplying Row 1 by . (This row operation is also called scaling. )          Our next step is to put zeros under this . To create a for the first entry in the second row, we'll use the multiply and add elementary row operation.          The first entry in the third row is already , so our first column looks good for reduced row echelon form. We now shift our focus from the leading down and to the right, to the position that is boxed.  We want to put a in this position, but we need to restrict ourselves to using only the second row and any rows below it , as using the first row would put nonzero entries back into the first column and undo the work we just did. Let's first swap Row 2 and Row 3, and then scale the new second row (multiply it by a number) so that there is a in the desired position.                  We have now created another leading , this time in the second row. Our next desire is to put 's underneath it, but that's already done! Therefore we again shift our attention down and to the right to the next position in a box. We want that to be a , and so we multiply the row by .          This ends what we will refer to as the forward steps . Our next task is to use the \"multiply and add\" row operation to put zeros above the leading 's. This is referred to as the backward steps .                  This matrix is now in reduced row echelon form, and we can read off the solution to the original linear system as , and .   We now summarize and try to formalize the steps we performed.   Forward Steps Gaussian elimination forward steps    Start at the top left corner.    If the entry in the row and column that we are considering is , swap rows with a row below the current row so that the entry is nonzero. If this entry is and all entries below are , we are done with this column; move to the right and do this step again.    Since the entry we are considering is nonzero, multiply the current row by a number ( scale the row ) to make its first entry a .    Repeatedly use the multiply and add row operation to put 's underneath the leading .    Move down and to the right. Go back to step 2 and work on the new rows and columns until you run out of either rows or columns.     The above steps accomplish the following things:   The first nonzero entry in each row is a .    Each leading is in a column to the right of the leading 's above it.    All rows of all 's come at the bottom of the matrix.     Note that this means we have just put a matrix into row echelon form . The next steps finish the conversion into reduced row echelon form.   Backward Steps Gaussian elimination backward steps    Starting from the bottom rightmost leading , use the multiply and add row operation repeatedly to put zeros above the leading .    Continue this process by moving up and to the left to the next leading , repeatedly use multiply and add to put zeros above the leading . Repeat this step until every leading has zeros above in all the rows.     By following these Forward and Backward Steps , we make use of the presence of zeros to make the computations easier and more efficient.  Many authors call the forward steps Gaussian elimination , which puts a matrix into row echelon form, and the forward-and-backward steps together Gauss-Jordan elimination , which puts a matrix into reduced row echelon form. We will almost always want to obtain reduced row echelon form and will not make a big deal about the distinction between the names Gaussian and Gauss-Jordan.     Gauss-Jordan Steps   Answer the following questions about using Gauss-Jordan elimination, which entries to work on next and what row operations to perform.     Given the matrix the Gauss-Jordan algorithm starts by turning the that is entry , into a . Which row operation do we use?      Scaling (multiplying a row by a nonzero number)    Correct!      Swapping rows    Swapping Row 1 and Row 2 would actually work for this matrix, and we'd end up in the same rref eventually. But part of the beauty of the Gauss-Jordan procedure is that following the prescribed steps of the algorithm always works, and swapping two rows won't always work to turn a into a .      Multiply and add    We use the multiply and add row operation when we are trying to get 's, not when our goal is to get a .        Given the matrix which entry do we focus on turning into a or next?            This entry is already a as required by the Gauss-Jordan method.            Correct! We need to turn the entries below the leading in Row 1 into 's.            No, we finish putting 's below the leading in the first column before moving to the right.        To turn the boxed entry below into a , which row operation do we perform?       Scaling a row    No, scaling a row means multiplying by a nonzero number which won't result in a if we didn't start with a .      Swapping rows    In this case, swapping Row 2 and Row 3 would put a into position , but that won't always work, and it just moves the problem down a row.      Multiply and add    Correct! Multiplying Row 1 by and adding to Row 2 will create a in position .        To continue the Gauss-Jordan algorithm on the matrix below, which entry do we next try to turn into a or ?            No, entry is the entry boxed below. The Gauss-Jordan algorithm says that after finishing a column, we move down and to the right from the leading .            No, entry is the entry boxed below. It's already a below a leading .            Correct! The next step in the Gauss-Jordan algorithm is to turn entry , which is boxed below, into a .         Given the matrix which row operation do we use next in the Gauss-Jordan algorithm?      Scaling a row    Correct!      Swapping rows    No, swapping rows is only used when there is a with nonzero entries below it.      Multiply and add    We use the multiply and add row operation when we are trying to get 's, not when our goal is to get a .       Let's practice the Gauss-Jordan algorithm some more.   Another Gauss-Jordan Elimination   Use Gauss-Jordan elimination to put the matrix into reduced row echelon form, where     We start by wanting to make the entry in the first column and first row a . To do this we'll scale the first row by a factor of .          Next we need to put zeros in the column below this newly formed leading .          Our attention now shifts to the right one column and down one row to the position indicated by the box. We want to put a in that position. Our only options are to either scale the current row or to interchange rows with a row below it. However, neither of those options will change the into a in this case. Therefore, we shift our attention to the right one more column, to the .     We want to create a leading for this row, so we multiply by a nonzero number.          Next we use multiply and add to put a underneath this leading .          We would continue moving down and to the right, but since the third row is all 's, and there aren't any more rows, we are done with the forward steps.  Our next goal is to put a above each of the leading 's.          This final matrix is in reduced row echelon form.     Gauss-Jordan Elimination Again, this time with fewer words   Put the matrix into reduced row echelon form.    Here we will show all steps without explaining each one.                                                    We were inspired by solving systems of linear equations to put matrices into reduced row echelon form, in order to make the solution easy to see. Every time we've started with a linear system, there was exactly one solution, and the reduced row echelon form always had one particular form. However, we've also practiced putting matrices in reduced row echelon form without referring back to their corresponding system of linear equations, and we have seen various different ways that the reduced row echelon form of a matrix can look. Connecting different reduced row echelon forms with solutions to the corresponding linear system is the topic for next section.   Gauss-Jordan Elimination   Describe how to perform Gauss-Jordan elimination in your own words.  If it helps you to describe the process, you can make up a specific matrix to use, or use an arbitrary one like .

What observations and questions do you have about these systems?                     Summary     A matrix could either be in reduced row echelon form or not. There are four conditions, concerning the locations of zero and nonzero entries, that must all be true for a matrix to be in reduced row echelon form.     Gauss-Jordan elimination is an algorithm that uses elementary row operations to efficiently transform a matrix into reduced row echelon form.    Matrices in reduced row echelon form are useful for finding the solution to a system of linear equations.

  "body": " Gauss-Jordan Elimination Demonstrated  Put the augmented matrix of the following system of linear equations into reduced row echelon form.   We start by converting the linear system into an augmented matrix.   Our first step is to make the first entry in the first row a . We do this by multiplying Row 1 by . (This row operation is also called scaling. )          Our next step is to put zeros under this . To create a for the first entry in the second row, we'll use the multiply and add elementary row operation.          The first entry in the third row is already , so our first column looks good for reduced row echelon form. We now shift our focus from the leading down and to the right, to the position that is boxed.  We want to put a in this position, but we need to restrict ourselves to using only the second row and any rows below it , as using the first row would put nonzero entries back into the first column and undo the work we just did. Let's first swap Row 2 and Row 3, and then scale the new second row (multiply it by a number) so that there is a in the desired position.                  We have now created another leading , this time in the second row. Our next desire is to put 's underneath it, but that's already done! Therefore we again shift our attention down and to the right to the next position in a box. We want that to be a , and so we multiply the row by .          This ends what we will refer to as the forward steps . Our next task is to use the \"multiply and add\" row operation to put zeros above the leading 's.

Given the matrix the Gauss-Jordan algorithm starts by turning the that is entry , into a . Which row operation do we use?      Scaling (multiplying a row by a nonzero number)    Correct!      Swapping rows    Swapping Row 1 and Row 2 would actually work for this matrix, and we'd end up in the same rref eventually. But part of the beauty of the Gauss-Jordan procedure is that following the prescribed steps of the algorithm always works, and swapping two rows won't always work to turn a into a .      Multiply and add    We use the multiply and add row operation when we are trying to get 's, not when our goal is to get a .        Given the matrix which entry do we focus on turning into a or next?            This entry is already a as required by the Gauss-Jordan method.            Correct! We need to turn the entries below the leading in Row 1 into 's.            No, we finish putting 's below the leading in the first column before moving to the right.

  "title": "Consistent and Inconsistent Systems",
  "body": " Consistent and Inconsistent Systems   We've learned how to take a linear system, turn it into an augmented matrix, and use Gauss-Jordan elimination to put the matrix into reduced row echelon form. We used the reduced row echelon form to see what the solution was to the original linear system, and in all the examples we've seen so far, there was exactly one solution.  In this section, we consider different possibilities for what the solutions to a linear system can be and see how we can identify those different possibilities from the reduced row echelon form that results after performing Gauss-Jordan elimination.    Prepare   Types of solutions  In , , , , and all of our other examples of linear systems, there was exactly one solution, that is, one possible assignment of values to the variables which made all of the equations in the system true at the same time. We now consider if that is always the case or not.   First, consider the following linear system with one equation: . This equation is true whenever . We can picture all of the possible solutions by thinking of the graph of the equation .   Graph of the line y=x and three points on the line    f(x) = x      (1,1)  (\\pi,\\pi)  (-5,-5)         Each single equation with two variables can be viewed in this way, as a line in the plane. Let's now consider systems of linear equations with two equations and two variables, so that there are two lines in the plane.   Consider the linear system . Since each equation can be viewed as a line and since the slopes of the lines are different, we know the lines will intersect somewhere, and that point of intersection is the only solution to the system.     f(x) = x  g(x) = -x+2              Now consider the linear system . While this system has two equations, the second is a multiple of the first. The thicker line is used to represent that we've drawn the same line twice. In this case, we have an infinite solution set, just as if we only had the one equation .     f(x) = x           Finally, consider the linear system . If the difference between and is , it can't also be . This linear system has no solution. We observe that the two lines are parallel and never intersect.     f(x) = x  g(x) = x-2             It becomes harder to visualize when we add variables, but no matter how many equations and variables we have, solutions to linear equations always come in one of three forms: exactly one solution, infinite solutions, or no solution. This is a fact that we will not prove here, but it deserves to be stated.   Solution Forms of Linear Systems  solution types  solution unique  solution infinite  solution none   Every linear system of equations has exactly one solution, infinite solutions, or no solution.    Visually, we think of the three options below, even though linear systems often have more than two equations and more than two variables.   The three possibilities for all linear systems; the systems pictured have two equations and two variables    One solution   Two intersecting lines    f(x) = x  g(x) = -x+2              Infinitely many solutions   Two lines that are the same line    f(x) = x           No solutions   Two parallel lines    f(x) = x  g(x) = x-2                 Determining Consistency  How can we tell whether a given system of linear equations has , , or infinitely many solutions? The answer to this question lies with the reduced row echelon form of its corresponding augmented matrix.  A note on using technology  When we are learning a new technique or procedure, it's good to go through all the steps ourselves because understanding the process has benefits. That's why we typically learn how to add numbers using manipulatives like blocks or fingers, with the goal of eventually being able to add faster without any aids; in fact, we eventually add numbers we never could have represented with physical manipulatives. The focus shifted from the ability to add for its own sake to solving a problem which required addition as a step.  In a similar way, once we are able to perform Gauss-Jordan elimination by hand for small systems, we move to using technology to quickly obtain the reduced row echelon form of a matrix. The focus is no longer on our ability to row reduce for its own sake but on answering a question which requires interpreting the result of row reducing a matrix.  There are many apps, websites, etc., which can produce the reduced row echelon form of a matrix very quickly. This book will use SageMath, a language which is built on Python and free. Hit the Evaluate (Sage) button below to see both the matrix and its reduced row echelon form.   The QQ in the Sage cell above is present for a technical reason, and the rest of syntax means that is being defined as a matrix, whose first row is and whose second row is .  Try modifying the contents of the above Sage cell to calculate the reduced row echelon form of a different matrix. Don't worry about messing anything up beyond repair; refreshing the page will reset the Sage cell back to its initial state.  From now on, we will give the reduced row echelon form of the matrix without showing work.   We begin by distinguishing between systems which have a solution (either one or infinitely many) and those which have no solution.   Consistency of Linear Systems  system of linear equations consistent  system of linear equations inconsistent  consistent  inconsistent   A system of linear equations is consistent if it has at least one solution. A linear system is inconsistent if it does not have a solution.    What happens in the reduced row echelon form if a linear system has no solutions?   A system with no solutions  Find the solution to the linear system    Answer: We put the corresponding augmented matrix into reduced row echelon form.   Now let us take the reduced matrix and write out the corresponding equations. The first two rows give us the equations .  So far, so good. However the last row gives us the equation . There are no values of and which can make . Therefore, no solution exists, and this system is inconsistent.   The key takeaway from is: if any row has a leading in the last column after row reducing the augmented matrix of a linear system, the system is inconsistent. Otherwise, the system is consistent, which means it has at least 1 solution.   Consistent or inconsistent?   For each of the following linear systems, say whether it is consistent or inconsistent.     The linear system whose augmented matrix in reduced row echelon form is .      Consistent    Correct!      Inconsistent    There is no row with a leading in the last column. The first row says that and the second row says that . If a linear system has a solution, it is consistent.        The linear system whose augmented matrix in reduced row echelon form is .      Consistent    Correct!      Inconsistent    There is no row with a leading in the last column. The first row says that and the second row says that , which is true.        The linear system whose augmented matrix has been row reduced to .      Consistent    There is a row with a leading in the last column. The third row says that , which is not true for any possible values of and . A system with no solutions is inconsistent.      Inconsistent    Correct!        The linear system pictured below.  Three lines with no common point of intersection    f(x) = x  g(x) = -x+2  h(x) = 1\/4*x-3                  Consistent    There is no common point of intersection. Each line is an equation, and there is no point which satisfies all three equations. The linear system pictured has no solution, which means it's inconsistent.      Inconsistent    Correct!       We've now seen a system which has no solution and systems which have exactly one solution such as , so let's look next at a system which has infinitely many solutions.   A system with infinitely many solutions  Find the solution to the linear system    Answer: To find the solution, put the corresponding matrix into reduced row echelon form.   Now convert this reduced matrix back into equations. We have . We solve for and in terms of and get   These two equations tell us that the values of and depend on what is. There is no restriction on what must be; it is free to take on the value of any real number. Since we have infinite choices for the value of , we have infinitely many solutions.    In the previous example we used the word free to describe a certain variable. What exactly is a free variable? How do we recognize which variables are free and which are not?   Dependent and Independent Variables   Consider the reduced row echelon form of an augmented matrix of a consistent system of linear equations. Then:    a variable that corresponds to a leading is a dependent , or determined , or basic variable, and variable dependent  variable basic  basic variable     a variable that does not correspond to a leading is a free , or independent variable. variable independent  variable free  free variable         applies only to consistent systems. If a system is inconsistent , then it's meaningless to talk about being free (or not) to pick values for the variables because there are no values which satisfy all the equations in the system.    helps us understand when a consistent system of linear equations will have infinitely many solutions. If a consistent system has no free variables, then there is exactly one solution; inversely, if there are any free variables, then there are infinitely many solutions.  Analyzing the solutions of a linear system  Consider the reduced row echelon form of the augmented matrix of a system of linear equations.   If there is a leading in the last column, the system has no solution.    Otherwise, if there is a leading for each variable, then there is exactly one solution.    Otherwise, there are infinite solutions because there are variables which are free to take on any value.      Number of solutions, free and basic variables   For each augmented matrix in reduced row echelon form, select all that is true about the corresponding linear system.            The variable is free.    There is a leading 1 in the first column, so is basic, or dependent.      The variable is free.    Correct!      The variable is free.    There is a leading 1 in the third column, so is basic, or dependent.      The variable is free.    Correct!      The variable is free.    This system doesn't have an . The last column in an augmented matrix corresponds to the constants of the equations, so there are only 4 columns corresponding to variables.               The system has no solutions.    There is no row with a leading 1 in the last column, so there is at least one solution.      The system has exactly 1 solution.    This consistent system doesn't have a leading 1 in every column corresponding to variables, and so there is more than 1 solution.      There are infinitely many solutions.    Correct!               The variable is free.    There is a leading 1 in the first column, so is basic, or dependent.      The variable is free.    There is a leading 1 in the second column, so is basic, or dependent.      The variable is free.    This system doesn't have an . The last column in an augmented matrix corresponds to the constants of the equations, so there are only 2 columns corresponding to variables.      There are no free variables.    Correct!               The system has no solutions.    There is no row with a leading 1 in the last column, so there is at least one solution.      The system has exactly 1 solution.    Correct!      There are infinitely many solutions.    Every variable has a leading 1 in its column, so there are no free variables.         More on Infinite Solutions  Systems with exactly one solution or no solution are the easiest to deal with; systems with infinite solutions are a bit harder, and we will often want to give one or two of the infinite possibilities.   Particular Solution  particular solution  solution particular   Consider a linear system of equations with infinite solutions. A particular solution is one solution.    The easiest way to find a particular solution is to pick specific values for the free variables which then determines the values of the dependent variables.   Infinite Solutions; Particular Solutions   Give the solution to a linear system whose augmented matrix in reduced row echelon form is and give two particular solutions.    Answer: We can ignore the third row as it does not give us any information about the solution. The first and second rows can be rewritten as the following equations: .  Notice how the variables and correspond to the leading 's of the given matrix. Therefore and are dependent variables; all other variables, in this case and , are free variables.  We generally write our solution with the dependent variables on the left and independent variables and constants on the right. It is also a good practice to acknowledge the fact that our free variables are, in fact, free. So all the solutions to the system would look something like .  To find particular solutions, choose any values you wish for the free variables.  For example, by setting , we get: . By setting and , we have the solution: .    The constants and coefficients of an augmented matrix work together to determine whether a given system of linear equations has one, infinite, or no solution. The coefficients determine whether a matrix will have exactly one solution or not. In the or not case, the constants determine whether the system has infinite solutions or no solution.     Matching Problem, Solution Types  matching solution types of linear systems   The matrices below are each the augmented matrix of a linear system. Sort the matrices by how many solutions the system has.     No solutions      One solution     Infinitely many solutions         Can there be a linear system which has exactly 3 solutions?

Construct two different inconsistent linear systems with 3 variables. Use Sage or another tool to calculate the reduced row echelon form of the augmented matrix of your linear systems.    Prompt students to create two conflicting equations, with the same coefficients but different constants, or perhaps to try a system with 4 or 5 equations and only 3 variables.      Construct a linear system with 5 variables that has infinitely many solutions. Use Sage or another tool to calculate the reduced row echelon form of the augmented matrix of your linear system.    Prompt students to try using fewer than 5 equations. See if any come up with an inconsistent system instead.    Analyzing the Effect of Different Coefficient and Constant Values   For what values of will the given system have exactly one solution, infinite solutions, or no solution?          If , there is exactly one solution; if , there are infinite solutions. It is not possible for this system to have no solutions.           If , there is exactly one solution; if , there are no solutions. It is not possible for this system to have infinite solutions.           If , there are infinitely many solutions; if , there is no solution. It is not possible for this system to have exactly 1 solution.           There is exactly one solution for all possible values of .        Summary     Every linear system has either no solutions, one solution, or infinitely many solutions. We call a linear system which has at least one solution consistent , and we call a linear system with no solutions inconsistent.     To analyze how many solutions a given linear system has, we examine the reduced row echelon form of the system's augmented matrix. We look for number and location of leading 's to see whether the system is inconsistent, or in the case that it is consistent, to see which variables are free or independent and which variables are basic or dependent .    If a linear system has infinitely many solutions, we can describe all the possible solutions by solving for the dependent variables in terms of the free variables, and we can also give particular solutions by choosing specific values for the free variables.

  "body": "A note on using technology  When we are learning a new technique or procedure, it's good to go through all the steps ourselves because understanding the process has benefits. That's why we typically learn how to add numbers using manipulatives like blocks or fingers, with the goal of eventually being able to add faster without any aids; in fact, we eventually add numbers we never could have represented with physical manipulatives. The focus shifted from the ability to add for its own sake to solving a problem which required addition as a step.  In a similar way, once we are able to perform Gauss-Jordan elimination by hand for small systems, we move to using technology to quickly obtain the reduced row echelon form of a matrix. The focus is no longer on our ability to row reduce for its own sake but on answering a question which requires interpreting the result of row reducing a matrix.  There are many apps, websites, etc., which can produce the reduced row echelon form of a matrix very quickly. This book will use SageMath, a language which is built on Python and free. Hit the Evaluate (Sage) button below to see both the matrix and its reduced row echelon form.   The QQ in the Sage cell above is present for a technical reason, and the rest of syntax means that is being defined as a matrix, whose first row is and whose second row is .  Try modifying the contents of the above Sage cell to calculate the reduced row echelon form of a different matrix. Don't worry about messing anything up beyond repair; refreshing the page will reset the Sage cell back to its initial state.  From now on, we will give the reduced row echelon form of the matrix without showing work.  "

  "title": "Problem Solving with Linear Systems",
  "body": " Problem Solving with Linear Systems   Most of the problems we've seen so far have started with a given linear system, and we learned how to find the solution(s) to the system by performing Gauss-Jordan elimination and interpreting the resulting reduced row echelon form.  In this section, we will consider problems where the linear system is hidden , that is, not stated in the problem. We will create a linear system to solve the problem, and we will also need to interpret the possible solution(s) in terms of the context of the question, where it's possible that not all values of the variables make sense.    Prepare  Let's start with an example.  Seats in a Baseball Stadium  A baseball stadium has seating arranged in three sections. As part of a special promotion, guests will receive two of three prizes. Guests seated in Sections A and B will receive a hat, guests seated in Sections B and C will receive a shirt, and guests seated in Sections A and C will receive a hot dog. The promoters told the stadium managers of their plans, and asked how many seats were in each section. The managers, thinking they were being helpful, told the promoters they would need hats, shirts, and hot dogs, and they have since been unavailable for further help. How many seats are in each section?  In order to answer this question, we need to make we know what is being asked. The final sentence of the question asks: How many seats are in each section?   Since we are trying to solve for the number of seats in each section, those should be our variables. Let be the number of seats in Section A, be the number of seats in Section B, and be the number of seats in Section C.  Now we use the information given to create linear equations. We were told that hats go to guests in Sections A and B and that we'll need hats, which means that Guests in Sections B and C get shirts, which means that . Lastly, guests in Sections A and C get hot dogs, which means that . Putting these three equations into a linear system results in , and the corresponding augmented matrix is .  To solve our system, we put the augmented matrix into reduced row echelon form and get .  Since , this means that Section A has seats. Similarly, we see that Section B has seats, and Section C has seats. This is a reasonable solution because the number of seats in each section is nonnegative and a whole number.   Let's recap and generalize our steps.   We made sure we knew what the problem was asking. ( How many seats in each section? )    We gave variable names to the unknown number of seats in each section. (Section A had number of seats, Section B had , and Section C had many seats.)    We used the information given in the problem to write down linear equations involving those variables.    We constructed an augmented matrix from the system of linear equations and put the matrix into reduced row echelon form.    We made sure the solution obtained from the reduced row echelon form made sense in the context of the problem. (The number of seats in a section couldn't have been a negative or fractional number like , for example.)     This set of problem-solving steps is important enough to say again.   Steps for Problem Solving with Linear Systems     Identify what is being asked.    Identify and give variable names to the unknown quantities whose values we need to find.    Use the information in the problem to write down linear equations involving the variables.    Form an augmented matrix from the system of linear equations and put the matrix into reduced row echelon form.    Check that any solution(s) found from the reduced row echelon form make sense in the context of the problem.       An example with points scoring in football  The most common ways to score points in an American football game are by touchdowns, extra points, 2-point conversions, and field goals. Touchdowns are worth points and are immediately followed by either an extra point worth point or by a 2-point conversion worth points. Field goals are worth points.  Suppose that in one game a team had scoring plays and scored a total of points. Each touchdown was followed by a successful extra point or 2-point conversion. How did the team score their points?  Let's go through our problem-solving steps.   Identify what is being asked  We are asked to find how the team scored their points.    Identify unknowns and name variables  We need to focus on the unknowns that answer the question: how many touchdowns, extra points, 2-point conversions, and field goals the team had.     Which quantities should be variables?   An American football team can score points via touchdowns, extra points, 2-point conversions, and field goals. We were given the total points scored and some other information and were asked to find how the team scored its points. What should the variables in this problem be?    The variables should be the things we are solving for, the ways to score points. Other information in the problem will get used as part of the linear equations which involve the variables.     Variables in this problem  The number of touchdowns,  The number of field goals,  The number of extra points,  The number of 2-point conversions,    Not variables in this problem  The number of points,  Points earned through touchdowns,  Extra points and 2-point conversions only come after touchdowns,        Form linear equations involving the variables  We are told that there were scoring plays, so . We were also told that the total number of points is , and that each touchdown is worth points, each field goal is worth , each extra point is worth and each 2-point conversion is worth points. This means that .  There is one more given piece of information: that every touchdown is followed by either an extra point or a 2-point conversion. This means that , or     Form augmented matrix and row reduce  Putting the three equations above into an augmented matrix and row reducing gives us .    Interpret solutions which make sense  The reduced row echelon form has a free variable in the fourth column. Turning each row of the matrix back into an equation results in .  Mathematically, the value of can be any real number, which means there are infinitely many solutions. However, in this problem stood for the number of field goals, and there can't be a negative or fractional number of field goals in a football game. The solution only makes sense if is .  Looking at the second equation , we see a further restriction on the value of . If then the value of is negative, and it doesn't make sense to have a negative number of extra points. Thus must be one of . Can we eliminate still more solutions?  Looking at the first equation , if then , but the number of touchdowns must be a whole number. We also get a fractional number of touchdowns if or if . The only remaining possibilities are or .  If , then and touchdowns each followed by an extra point plus a field goal adds up to points in scoring plays.  If , then and touchdowns, one followed by an extra point and one by a 2-point conversion, plus field goals also adds up to points in scoring plays.      We see that sometimes there's a lot of work involved in interpreting the solutions which make sense. In the case of points in a football game, there were infinitely many solutions which made mathematical sense, but only two solutions which made sense as actual ways to score points meeting the necessary conditions.   Which solutions make sense?     Consider a linear system whose augmented matrix and reduced row echelon form are shown below. Note that this translates back to equations as Which of the following values is a possible solution for , , and ?       , ,     Correct!       , ,     Correct!       , ,     Correct!       , ,     Correct!        A woman has total bills in her purse, consisting of , and bills, giving her a total of . How many bills of each denomination does she have?  Let , and be the number of ones, fives and tens, respectively, and suppose that the problem has been solved as far as Which of the following values is a possible solution for , , and ?       , ,     She can't have one-dollar bills, or five-dollar bills.       , ,     She can't have a negative amount of ten-dollar bills.       , ,     Correct! This is a total of bills, and ones plus fives add up to .  If you had to pick one solution only, this one is likely not the best choice because the wording consisting of might imply that she has at least one of each type of bill.       , ,     Correct! This is a total of bills, and ones, fives, and tens add up to .       Let's do another example, one which involves balancing a chemical equation. All chemical reaction problems found in this text are thanks to Gregory Bard and Gergely Sirokman.   Balancing a chemical equation  When chemicals react, no elements are created or destroyed; instead they recombine into different substances. For example, a blow torch works by burning acetylene in the presence of oxygen . The result is carbon dioxide and water . If there were atoms of carbon (as part of the acetylene) before the reaction, then there have to be atoms of carbon (in the form of carbon dioxide) after the reaction also.  In chemistry, balancing a chemical equation means finding the smallest numbers of the different molecules involved in the reaction. Most students of chemistry balance equations by guessing and checking, but there's actually a system of linear equations involved, which means there's an algorithm which always leads to a solution.  Let's balance the blow torch reaction, using our problem solving steps.   We need to find the coefficients of each of the molecules, so those are the unknowns we should give names to. Let's say there are many molecules of , and many molecules of , and many molecules of , and many molecules of .   Now we consider each element and the number of atoms there are before and after the reaction.  For carbon, which is denoted by , there are molecules of , and there are carbon atoms in each of the molecules, which means there are carbon atoms before the reaction takes place. After the reaction (or after the arrow), there are molecules of and carbon atom in each molecule, which means there are many atoms of carbon after the reaction occurs. Because the number of carbon atoms must be the same before and after the reaction, we get the equation , or restated in the form which has the constant after the equal sign as .  Next, we examine hydrogen, which is denoted by . Before the reaction there were hydrogen atoms in each of the molecules of , for a total of hydrogen atoms. After the reaction, there are hydrogen atoms in each of the molecules of , for a total of hydrogen atoms. This gives the equation , or moving the variables to the left side of the equal sign, .  Finally, we look at oxygen, denoted by . Note that there is oxygen in both of the molecules that appear after the reaction. There were oxygen atoms before the reaction took place, and after the reaction there are oxygen atoms in each of the molecules of and oxygen atom in each of the molecules of , which means there is a total of oxygen atoms after the reaction. This gives us the equation , or .  We put these equations into an augmented matrix and then find the reduced row echelon form .  Note that the variable is free, which means that mathematically, can take on any value. What happens if we let ? The third row says that , which means that . The second row says that , which means that , and the first row says that , which means that .  However, it is impossible to have a fractional number of molecules. To clear the denominator, let's multiply by and let instead of . Then the particular solution becomes and the balanced equation is . Note that it makes sense to have infinitely many solutions to the linear system, since multiplying the whole thing by or or any whole positive number will keep the reaction balanced with equal numbers of each element's atoms before and after the arrow.      Parsons Problem, Equation of a Quadratic Through 3 Points   Select the correct steps to find the equation of the quadratic function that goes through the points , and .      A quadratic function has equation .     , , , , and are all unknowns which need to be solved for.     and refer to points in the plane, so the unknowns to solve for are the coefficients , , and .    Passing through the point means the equation holds when and , so we get the equation .    The two remaining points gives us the equations and .    Rewriting the set of linear equations gives us .    Putting the equations into an augmented matrix and then row reducing gives .    The solution is , and , which is the quadratic function .      Parsons Problem, Balancing a Chemical Equation   Select the steps to balance the chemical equation below.       We are looking for the values of such that     Looking at the element calcium , we have atoms before the reaction and atoms of calcium after the reaction takes place, so .    Similarly, looking at the number of atoms of oxygen before and after the reaction gives us the equation , while examining hydrogen gives the equation , and considering phosphorus results in .    Putting these equations into an augmented matrix and then row reducing gives     Turning the reduced row echelon form back into equations results in     Letting yields a final answer of .    Letting yields a final answer of .      Reflection     How confident do you feel with the material you just read about?      Not at all confident or didn't do the reading.

Participate     Be able to use linear systems and reduced row echelon form to solve problems in different contexts where the linear system is not immediately apparent.    Be able to identify unknowns and constraints , or in other words, variables and equations involving those variables.    Build on our past work interpreting solutions to a linear system from the reduced row echelon form by further restricting to solutions which make sense in the context of a given problem.         Suppose we know that in a football game there were points scored from scoring occasions and also that the number of successful extra point kicks was equal to the number of successful two point conversions. Find all ways in which the points may have been scored in this game.    The only way which meets all the conditions and makes sense is by scoring field goals.    The augmented matrix from this system is . From this we find the solution .  The only time each of these variables are nonnegative integers is when or . If , then we have touchdowns, extra points and two point conversions (and field goals); this doesn't make sense since the extra points and two point conversions follow touchdowns. If , then we have no touchdowns, extra points or two point conversions (just field goals). This is the only solution; all points were scored from field goals.      Pure elemental phosphorous and hypochlorous acid react in water to make phosphoric acid and hydrochloric acid . Balance the chemical equation .    The balanced equation is .    We are looking for . Consider the number of atoms of each element before and after the reaction. Turning this system into an augmented matrix and row reducing results in We want the smallest possible numbers such that no value is negative or fractional, so let . Then and the balanced equation is .        You might know that two points determine a line. That's because in a line there are two unknowns: the coefficient of the term and the constant term. Note that in we needed three points to determine a specific quadratic function because there were three unknowns: the coefficient of the term, the coefficient of the term and the coefficient of the constant term.     Find the smallest degree polynomial which goes through the points , , and .           Go through the same steps to attempt to find a quadratic function through the points , , and . What do you get, and why does the answer make sense?    The coefficient of the term is , giving the linear function . The three given points all lie on a line.       In a basketball game, where points are scored either by a point shot, a point shot or a point free throw, there were points scored from successful shots. Find all ways in which the points may have been scored in this game.    There are possible solutions:    free throws, two-point shots, three-point shots     free throws, two-point shots, three-point shots     free throws, two-point shots, three-point shots     free throws, two-point shots, three-point shots     free throws, two-point shots, three-point shots     free throws, two-point shots, three-point shots       Let , and represent the number of free throws, 2 point and 3 point shots taken. The augmented matrix from this system is . From this we find the solution .  In order for and to be nonnegative, we need . Thus there are different scenarios: the first is where three point shots are taken, no free throws, and two point shots; the last is where three point shots are taken, free throws, and no two point shots.       Summary     Many problems in different areas of sports, science, computer science, artificial intelligence and machine learning, and other areas can be solved using linear systems.    These problems often don't appear already phrased in terms of variables and linear equations, but there are problem solving steps we can use to frame the problem in terms of linear systems and an augmented matrix we can put into reduced row echelon form.    Interpreting the possible solutions in terms of which ones make sense in the context of the problem is necessary and often quite involved.

In chemistry, balancing a chemical equation means finding the smallest numbers of the different molecules involved in the reaction. Most students of chemistry balance equations by guessing and checking, but there's actually a system of linear equations involved, which means there's an algorithm which always leads to a solution.  Let's balance the blow torch reaction, using our problem solving steps.   We need to find the coefficients of each of the molecules, so those are the unknowns we should give names to. Let's say there are many molecules of , and many molecules of , and many molecules of , and many molecules of .   Now we consider each element and the number of atoms there are before and after the reaction.  For carbon, which is denoted by , there are molecules of , and there are carbon atoms in each of the molecules, which means there are carbon atoms before the reaction takes place. After the reaction (or after the arrow), there are molecules of and carbon atom in each molecule, which means there are many atoms of carbon after the reaction occurs. Because the number of carbon atoms must be the same before and after the reaction, we get the equation , or restated in the form which has the constant after the equal sign as .  Next, we examine hydrogen, which is denoted by . Before the reaction there were hydrogen atoms in each of the molecules of , for a total of hydrogen atoms. After the reaction, there are hydrogen atoms in each of the molecules of , for a total of hydrogen atoms. This gives the equation , or moving the variables to the left side of the equal sign, .  Finally, we look at oxygen, denoted by . Note that there is oxygen in both of the molecules that appear after the reaction. There were oxygen atoms before the reaction took place, and after the reaction there are oxygen atoms in each of the molecules of and oxygen atom in each of the molecules of , which means there is a total of oxygen atoms after the reaction. This gives us the equation , or .  We put these equations into an augmented matrix and then find the reduced row echelon form .  Note that the variable is free, which means that mathematically, can take on any value. What happens if we let ? The third row says that , which means that . The second row says that , which means that , and the first row says that , which means that .  However, it is impossible to have a fractional number of molecules. To clear the denominator, let's multiply by and let instead of . Then the particular solution becomes and the balanced equation is . Note that it makes sense to have infinitely many solutions to the linear system, since multiplying the whole thing by or or any whole positive number will keep the reaction balanced with equal numbers of each element's atoms before and after the arrow.

  "title": "Introduction to Matrix Arithmetic",
  "body": " Introduction to Matrix Arithmetic   We will stop thinking about matrices as representing linear systems, and instead think of matrices as being kind of like numbers.  When we were children, we learned about numbers and their names and numerals, then how to count, how to add, subtract, and multiply, and various properties of those operations that led us to be able to solve equations containing unknown numbers. All of this took years to became second nature, but we will build on the knowledge and familiarity with how numbers work to understand how matrices work.    Prepare  We defined a matrix in , and included defining rows, columns, and notation for the size of a matrix and for the entries within a matrix. An augmented matrix, whose entries represent the coefficients and constants in a linear system, is a type of matrix or a way of interpreting a matrix, but when we look at a matrix we don't have to think of a linear system at all. A matrix is an array of numbers; both the size of the array and the contents are important to the essence of a matrix.   Adding matrices  Matrix addition We add two matrices by adding the numbers in their corresponding positions. For example, Because numbers can be added in either order and the answer is the same, for example , it follows that adding matrices in either order results in the same matrix also.   Subtraction and multiplying by numbers can be related back to addition, for example and , so it makes sense that subtracting two matrices and multiplying a matrix by a number also work by doing the operation to each entry in the matrix.  We know that numbers can sometimes appear in different forms but really be the same number: for example, , , are all different ways to write the number two . Two matrices are equal if each corresponding position contains the same number, regardless of the form of the number.  Let's try some examples.  Matrix Operations   Define matrices , , and by      Select all answers which are equal to            Correct!           Correct!           Correct!        Select all answers which are equal to            Correct!           This is , subtracted in the other order.           Correct!        Select all answers which are equal to            This is .           Correct!           Correct!           This is .        Select all answers which are equal to .           Correct!           Correct!               is a matrix containing all zeros, while the given matrix was a matrix containing all zeros.        Select all answers which are equal to            Matrix and matrix have different sizes, so there are positions without corresponding entries to add. For example, the third column of has nothing corresponding in .      Trick question! is not defined    Correct! and have different sizes so there are positions which don't have corresponding entries to add.       We never had to worry about whether two numbers could be added or subtracted, so that is a difference between numbers and matrices. The size of a matrix is key to being able to perform calculations; only matrices of the same size can be added and subtracted, and if two matrices have different sizes, then they cannot be equal.  Matrices containing all zeros come up enough that we should define them.   The Zero Matrix    zero matrix  matrix the zero matrix The matrix containing in every entry, denoted , is the zero matrix of size  .  When the dimensions are clear from the context, we just write in bold font and call it the zero matrix , even though there is a different zero matrix for each size.    Note the difference between and : the first is a number and the second is a matrix in which every entry is the number .  Lots of things we've known are true about adding and subtracting numbers are true for matrices also, and we'll collect them here.   Properties of Adding Matrices and of Multiplying a Matrix by a Number   matrix arithmetic properties  If , and are matrices, and is a number, then the following equalities are all true.  Commutative Property      Associative Property      Number Multiplication Distributive Property      Number Multiplication Commutative Property      Additive Identity      Multiplying by the Number Equals the Zero Matrix          Matrix Property Names   Match each property to its correct name.  Let , and be matrices and let be a number.    Distributive  Commutativity of Addition  Associativity of Addition          You might have noticed that there are a couple of operations we do with numbers that we have not discussed how to do with matrices, namely, multiplication and division. There's a very good reason for this: multiplication and division in the realm of matrices are very different from multiplication and division of numbers, and we leave them for future sections.     In your own words, explain how to add two matrices together. Be sure to discuss if addition is always possible or if not, what conditions need to be satisfied.     True or False?    There is exactly one Zero Matrix.    There is one matrix of all zeros for each size. However, , for example.      Multiplying a matrix by means multiplying each entry in the matrix by .    True, this is how we define multiplying a matrix by a number.     Reflection     How confident do you feel with the material you just read about?      Not at all confident or didn't do the reading.      Not very confident.      Somewhat confident.      Mostly confident.      Confident so far and ready to engage more deeply.         Ask a question about the material. What additional information do you think someone would need to become more confident in their understanding?        Participate     Begin to view matrices as objects similar to numbers, which can be added, subtracted, and multiplied by a number.    Be able to perform matrix addition and multiplication by a number and use properties of these operations.      We have discussed multiplying a matrix by a number. Most texts will use the term scalar instead of number . There are good reasons for this, but they are outside the scope of this material. Still, it is good to recognize both words could be used.      Consider the matrices and . Say why and are not equal as matrix objects. Does this make sense to you, or do you think they should be the same thing?    They are not the same size, so they can't be equal as matrices. However, they contain the exact same information and the only difference is the orientation of the writing.      What do you think a square matrix is? What about a row matrix or column matrix ?    A square matrix is , same number of rows as columns. A row matrix is , written as one row, while a column matrix is , written as one column.      Let , , and .  Calculate each of the items below. What do you notice about your answers?      , and      ,        and      , ,            ,       , , and      , , and .         Consider the list of proposed properties below. For each one, say whether it is True, False, or Insufficient Information. Note that these are all statements you might be used to thinking about with numbers, and the goal is to think about how matrices and numbers are similar in some ways and different in some ways.  Let , , and be matrices of the same size, and let and be numbers.          True. Discuss subtracting versus multiplying by and adding, possibly additive inverses.           True, another distributive property.      If then .    False, subtracting from both sides gives .      If then .    True, multiplying both sides by the number .      If then .    Insufficient Information. We don't yet know what multiplying by a matrix means, and certainly not what dividing by a matrix might mean.           True. Multiplying a matrix by a number in either order comes down to multiplying the number entries together in either order, and number multiplication is commutative.           Insufficient information. We don't yet know what multiplying by a matrix means. This is true for numbers, however.      For each matrix , there is a matrix such that . (The matrix acts like the number does for numbers.)    True, the zero matrix of the appropriate size. But there are different zero matrices and only one number .      For each matrix , there is a matrix such that . (The matrix acts like the number does for numbers.)    Insufficient Information.         Summary     Matrices are mathematical objects like numbers are. We don't need to think of matrices as coming from a linear system.    Matrices can be multiplied by numbers (also called scalars). If two matrices are the same size, they can be added and subtracted.    Many of the properties we're used to still hold for matrix addition and multiplication by a number, such as associativity and commutativity of addition and the distributive property.

  "body": " Matrix Multiplication   Last section, we learned how to add and subtract matrices of the same size and how to multiply a matrix of any size by a number. In this section, we learn how to multiply two matrices together when their sizes allow for multiplication.   Prepare  Matrices of the same size are added by adding corresponding entries together, but we do not multiply matrices by multiplying corresponding entries together. This is confusing at first, but there are very good reasons for defining matrix multiplication differently. Unfortunately, most of those reasons do not become understandable until much, much later.  To start, two matrices can be multiplied together only if the number of columns in the first matrix equals the number of rows in the second matrix . This means that a matrix can be multiplied by a matrix, or a matrix, or a or etc. matrix, but a matrix cannot be multiplied by another matrix.  That's already pretty surprising, so let's check our understanding.    Define matrices , , and by      Can matrix be multiplied by matrix ? In other words, is defined?      Yes    No, because the first matrix, , has columns, but the second matrix, , does not have rows.      No    Correct! The first matrix, , has columns, but the second matrix, , has rows.        Can matrix be multiplied by matrix ? In other words, is defined?      Yes    Correct! The first matrix, , has columns, and the second matrix, , has rows.      No    The first matrix, , has columns, and the second matrix, , has rows. These are equal.        Can matrix be multiplied by matrix ? In other words, is defined?      Yes    No, because the first matrix, , has columns, but the second matrix, , does not have rows.      No    Correct! The first matrix, , has columns, but the second matrix, , has rows.        Consider the two statements below.    is defined.     is defined.   Which of the following choices is correct?      Both statements are true.     is the same as . The first matrix, , has columns, but the second matrix, , does not have rows.      1. is true but 2. is false     is the same as . The first matrix, , has columns, but the second matrix, , does not have rows.      1. is false and 2. is true    Correct! Any square matrix can be multiplied by itself, since the number of columns equals the number of rows.      Both statements are false.    Any square matrix can be multiplied by itself, since the number of columns equals the number of rows.       To begin to understand why the number of columns of the first matrix must equal the number of rows of the second matrix, we demonstrate how to multiply a matrix by a matrix.   Multiplying on the right by a column matrix   Suppose we have the matrices and below: . Their product is defined by multiplying the first column of by the first number in , and multiplying the second column of by the second number in , and adding the results.   If we look at the first entry, we see it came from , and we note that the first row of is . Looking at the second entry of we have , and the second row of is . The third entry of is , and the third row of is .  This means that we can view matrix multiplication entry-wise as multiplying the numbers in a row of the first matrix by the numbers in a column of the second matrix and adding them up.    Note that in the matrix has two columns and so we needed to contain two numbers in its column, which means has two rows. On the other hand, since has three rows, the result of multiplying a column of by a number still has three rows, and adding matrices keeps the size the same, which is why the product has three rows.  This generalizes to when the second matrix of the product has more columns than . The product is defined when is an matrix and is an matrix, and the matrix will have size . Let's see this in action in an example.  Matrix Multiplication, More than One Column   Let's calculate .   Since the first matrix has columns and the second matrix has rows, this multiplication can be performed. The product will be a matrix because the first matrix has rows and the second matrix has columns.  We form a matrix , and we will now calculate the value of each of the entries.  The entry is in the first row and first column, so we use the first row of the first matrix and the first column of the second matrix , multiply corresponding number entries and add them up. Thus . We now know that the product looks like .  Moving to the next entry to the right , we still use the first row of the first matrix , now with the second column of the second matrix , giving us . Finishing the first row with , we use the first row of the first matrix and the third column of the second matrix and obtain . So far we have .  To compute the second row, we use the second row of the first matrix with the first, then second, and finally third columns of the second matrix. We calculate . Putting it all together, we have .    Let's check to see that we understand how to compute the entries of a product of two matrices.   Entries in Matrix Multiplication   Match each entry of a matrix product to which things need to be multiplied together and added up, if applicable.       first row of  second row of  third row of  first column of  second column of  third column of  first entry of  first entry of      Another Matrix Multiplication   Calculate .    Since the first matrix has columns and the second matrix has rows, this multiplication can be performed. The product will be a matrix because the first matrix has rows and the second matrix has columns.  We form a matrix , and we will now calculate the value of each of the entries.  The entry is in the first row and first column, so we use the first row of the first matrix and the first column of the second matrix , multiply corresponding number entries and add them up. Thus . We now know that the product looks like .  Moving to the next entry to the right , we still use the first row of the first matrix , now with the second column of the second matrix , giving us . So far we have .  To compute , we use the second row of the first matrix with the first column of the second matrix , and calculate . To compute , we use the second row of the first matrix with the second column of the second matrix , and calculate .  Putting it all together, we have .     Matrix multiplication is a lot more complicated than addition or multiplication by a number, but it turns out to be very useful and connected to solving linear systems.    Sizes of Matrix Products   Define matrices , , and by Matrix the matrix products to their correct sizes.        Product is not defined       Addition versus Multiplication   Match the correct statements and methods.     Add corresponding entries              Matrices can't be added because the number of rows of the first does not equal the number of columns of the second.  Matrices can't be multiplied because they aren't the same size.  Multiply corresponding entries      Reflection     How confident do you feel with the material you just read about?      Not at all confident or didn't do the reading.      Not very confident.      Somewhat confident.      Mostly confident.      Confident so far and ready to engage more deeply.         If you're not fully confident, what additional information would you need to become more confident? What is confusing you?  If you are confident, ask a what if? or extension question.

Consider the matrices .     Is defined, and if so, what size is it?           Is defined, and if so, what size is it?

Here is a sage cell to perform (or check) the required computations.      Compute and then , and record your answers.      Compute and then and record your answers.      What does this suggest about the associativity of matrix multiplication?    Matrix multiplication is associative (when matrices are of the appropriate sizes).      Compute and then and record your answers.      Compute , and then (recall you computed in Part ).      What does this suggest about the distributive property of matrix multiplication?    Matrix multiplication is distributive (when matrices are of the appropriate sizes).          Summary     Matrix multiplication can be performed only when the number of columns in the first matrix equals the number of rows in the second matrix.    If matrix multiplication can be performed, the entries come from multiplying rows of the first matrix by columns of the second matrix. We multiply the corresponding numbers and add them up to get one entry of the product.    Some properties of multiplication of numbers also hold for multiplication of matrices, and some don't. Perhaps the most surprising or important of these properties is that matrix multiplication is not commutative in general.      Practice  Properties of Matrix Multiplication     Enter T or F depending on whether the statement is true or false. (You must enter T or F -- True and False will not work.)    If A is a square matrix such that equals the 0 matrix, then A must equal the 0 matrix.    If A has size and B has size , then AB has size .    If A has size and B has size , then the 3rd row, 2nd column entry of AB is obtained by multiplying the 3rd column of A by the 2nd row of B.          Matrix Multiplication Commutativity    Give an example of two matrices and such that .            More Commutativity    Give an example of two matrices and , neither of which is the zero matrix or the identity matrix, such that .            Multiplying Matrices   Many programming languages, including Python and Sage, use a list of lists to enter matrices. We use that notation in this problem instead of the usual array answer box notation to avoid giving away information about the size of the matrix or whether such a matrix exists at all.     Let   If possible, compute the following. If an answer does not exist, enter DNE .

  "body": " Matrix Inverses and Two Variable Systems   We have been learning how to perform arithmetic with matrices, including matrix multiplication. Now we learn how matrix multiplication connects to linear systems and how to solve two variable linear systems using the inverse of a matrix.    Prepare  Let's start by seeing how a two-variable linear system can viewed in terms of matrix multiplication.  Consider the linear system . Previously, we would have solved this system by forming an augmented matrix with the coefficients and constants, row reduce, and interpret the solutions from the reduced row echelon form.  However, now that we know about matrix multiplication, let's try something different. Form a matrix from the coefficients, , a column matrix from the variables, , and a column matrix from the constants, .  Notice what we get when we multiply : . Recall that two matrices are equal exactly when they are the same size and their corresponding entries are equal. So the matrix equation is , and setting the first entries equal to each other and the second entries equal to each other gives . But this is precisely the linear system we started with! This result is not an coincidence: we can always rewrite linear systems using matrix multiplication. Let's practice.   Viewing Linear Systems as Matrix Multiplication   Consider the linear systems on the left, and write them in terms of matrix multiplication as for the correct choices of , , and .               Writing linear systems in terms of matrix multiplication raises a new question: how can we solve a linear system that is written in the form ?  We take our inspiration from the usual algebra of numbers. If and are numbers and , then we solve the equation by dividing both sides by and get . We do this precisely because , so writing out more details would give us . The key feature is that is the thing we multiply by to get ; to solve a linear system , we'll want to do something analogous for matrices. We sometimes call the multiplicative inverse of , and we know that if written as an exponent. We will use this same language and notation for matrices as well.  In , we learned about the identity matrix that acts like the number for square matrices. For example, the identity matrix of size is , and then if is any matrix, then . Similarly for the identity matrix of size , which is and any matrix.  If we had a matrix such that , then by analogy to our algebra example above it seems like we might be able to solve the linear system for by multiplying both sides of the equation by . That is, . It seems that we might be able to solve linear systems using matrix multiplication and inverses instead of row reducing.  Of course, there are some differences between matrix multiplication and number multiplication, as we explored throughout Matrix Multiplication Participate , and one consequence is that we aren't guaranteed that a matrix acting like exists for every square matrix . For the matrices that arise from two-variable linear systems, it is straightforward to tell when exists.  Invertible Matrices and the Inverse of A matrix inverse  inverse definition   Let be an matrix. If there exists an matrix such that , then    is invertible .     is the multiplicative inverse , or just inverse , of , denoted by .    Furthermore, if is a matrix , the matrix exists precisely when and then .   Note that there are many matrices where there is no matrix that can be multiplied by to get the identity matrix; in this case, we say that is not invertible.     We can't divide by , so if , we don't have an inverse.  A Matrix Without An Inverse   Recall , where . Here, and so doesn't have an inverse.  This is why multiplying by in that exercise didn't act like multiplying by a number does; every nonzero number has an inverse .     Identifying Key Parts for an Inverse   The formula for the inverse of any matrix depends on viewing the matrix in the form . Let .   >  Identify the values of and for the matrix .       and     For a matrix described by , the entry is the entry in the top left and is the entry in the bottom right.       and     Correct!       and     For a matrix described by , the entry is the entry in the top left and is the entry in the bottom right.       and     For a matrix described by , the entry is the entry in the top left and is the entry in the bottom right.      >  Identify the values of and for the matrix .       and     For a matrix described by , the entry is the entry in the top right and is the entry in the bottom left.       and     For a matrix described by , the entry is the entry in the top right and is the entry in the bottom left.       and     Correct!       and     Don't multiply them by like in the inverse, just identify what and are to start with.      >  What is the value of for the matrix ?           Correct! , , , and , so             , , , and , so             , , , and , so             , , , and , so       >  Which matrix below is for the matrix ?           To calculate , you swap entries and and multiply entries and by negative 1.           To calculate , you swap entries and and multiply entries and by negative 1.           Correct!

Correct!           Multiply by , not .       Let's see another example.  Using the formula for inverses   Calculate the inverse, if it exists, of . If exists, use it to solve the linear system     Since , we know exists and we calculate   We can leave our answer in this form, or we could multiply it out and get .  To solve the system , we write . We check that and see that , is indeed a solution to the given linear system.     Invertible or Not?   Match the correct matrices and properties.
